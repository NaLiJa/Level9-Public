Knight Orc features:

* High level commands. You don't need to map Knight Orc: GO, RUN, 
  FIND and FOLLOW work out the route to a named place or object and 
  take you there. And ambushes are Orc-kid's play when you can just 
  enter WAIT FOR INNKEEPER AND KILL HIM. 

* Simultaneous actions: when you give people commands, you can get 
  on with the game while they carry them out.

* Realistic characters: a cast of 70 who make their own decisions 
  and live their own lives (e.g stealing treasure to buy their next 
  beer), whether or not you're still around to see them.

* Masses of text: occupying 240,000 bytes of source file. The text 
  is compressed to fit on the game disk, of course.

* 21 spells to use in off-beat ways.


Features of Level 9's Adventure System on 16 bit machines:

* Digitised Pictures, on both colour and Black & White monitors; 
  displayed, in a tasteful border, by a pseudo-random fade.

* RAM SAVE/RESTORE and UNDO: save your position in memory, so you 
  don't need to fiddle with data disks.

* Command-line editor, with a 1K buffer of your previous input 
  lines. Useful if you make mistaks; it combines well with 'undo'.

* Three programs, loading automatically as needed, to avoid the 
  memory limitations that can restrict one-part adventures.

* Multi-tasking: e.g the game continues while pictures load.

* Picture cache: prevents unnecessary disk loads, speeding the game 
  and avoiding disk wear. 

* Hard disk use. Owners of Winchesters should be able to load Knight 
  Orc onto hard disk and run it from there (making one copy, for the 
  player's own use, as long as they still have the original).
