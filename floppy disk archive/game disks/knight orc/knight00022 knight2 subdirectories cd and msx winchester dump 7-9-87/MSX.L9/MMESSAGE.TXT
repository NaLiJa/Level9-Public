; The word type ^C is used when a word
; is not to be used as part of the normal parsing
; but is to be available for checking should it be needed
; This is so references to scenery may be checked for
; containing particular words.
; This word type replaces Proper Nouns in this game.
;
; Special ST notes:
;
; The vertical bar used to end the printable part
; of a message is found by shifting the backslash
; (next to the left hand shift key)
;
; The ^ used for wordtypes is shift-6
;
; Changes to make to KO1 text:
;
; add 'inside' to preposition list for in.
; move 'about' from noun to prep.
; add 3746 - 'a voice in the dark says...'

I'll tell you where there is a treasure beyond price. What
do you say?" ]

worth living. I shall help you, for a while, and might even deign
