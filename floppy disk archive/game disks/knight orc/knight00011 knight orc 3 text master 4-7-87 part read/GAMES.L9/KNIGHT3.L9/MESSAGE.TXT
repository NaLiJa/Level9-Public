; The word type ^C is used when a word
; is not to be used as part of the normal parsing
; but is to be available for checking should it be needed
; This is so references to scenery may be checked for
; containing particular words.
; This word type replaces Proper Nouns in this game.
;
; Special ST notes:
;
; The vertical bar used to end the printable part
; of a message is found by shifting the backslash
; (next to the left hand shift key)

; The ^ used for wordtypes is shift-6
;
; Changes to make to KO1 text:
;
; add 'inside' to preposition list for in.
; move 'about' from noun to prep.
; add 3746 - 'a voice in the dark says...'

stink. Grok has survived countless take-over bids by other 
orcs, including one where your falling tree flattened his head 
a bit. He never found who did that, fortunately, but other 
"candidates" have not been so lucky; one reason why you meet 
so few orcs nowadays] ; Grok
[607:a greedy orc with a wide nose, cold feet and a chip on his 
shoulder] ; Oink
[608:an unusually cunning and devious orc, fully capable of

shadows. (Which must be difficult when you smell like 
him)] ; Sam the Grey Earl

his orange hair] ; Heathcliffe

Wild Hunt at home] ; Herne the Hunter

an advertising placard, but we won't go into that] ; Erik Bloodeagle
[621:a tall, black-bearded man with staring eyes and a face like 
a clenched fist] ; the Prophet of Greater Manchester
[622:a white-robed magician, armed with the cunning and cowardice 
of his kind. Do you ever see wizards on guard duty? Or in the front 
line of the army? No! At least, not for long. Hehehe] ; the wily Wizard
[623:very average] ; John Doe
[624:a blend of psychopath and shop-floor dummy. Avoid him like the 
plague] ; the Liquidiser (human)
[625:like a chain of Butcher's shops on two legs] ; Thud the Barbarian
[626:wandering about, getting steadily more confused] ; Susan

little else. She seems to be trying unsuccessfully to get onto 
the box cover] ; Amazon Grace
[628:the sort of woman who brings tears to your eyes] ; the Lady of Shallot
[629:a shimmering, ever-changing figure of magic and mystery.

which peek from beneath her gossamer robes] ; Dame Luck
