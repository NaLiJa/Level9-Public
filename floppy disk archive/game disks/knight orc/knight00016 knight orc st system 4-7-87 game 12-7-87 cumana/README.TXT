Hi! 

Just a short word of welcome from Level 9, creators of Knight Orc. We hope
you enjoy your time as a vile goblin and find that playing an orc is an 
interesting change.

If you discover any oddities or bugs (perish the thought!); or if you have 
some suggestions or ideas for improvements, please write to us at the 
address below so that future ST games can be even better.

HELP! If you are stuck, the packaging includes instructions for contacting 
Rainbird/Firebird for help. If you would rather write to Level 9 direct
you are very welcome, but please enclose a self-addressed envelope and a 
stamp (or an international reply coupon) for our reply. Be sure you say 
you have the ST version of Knight Orc.

ST FEATURES. In addition to its advanced game facilities (eg FOLLOW person,
GOTO place or object, WAIT for person, and the ability to give people like 
Denzyl complex orders to carry out while you get on with playing the game),
ST Knight Orc provides: 
 pictures on colour AND black-and-white monitors;
 picture cache (avoiding unnecessary disk loads); 
 previous command recall and editing, by cursor keys and DELETE;
 SAVE/RESTORE (save position on a disk of your choice);
 RAM SAVE/RESTORE (save your position in memory);
 OOPS (take back move. Larger STs permit many OOPSes in succession). 

HARD DISKS AND DOUBLE SIDED DRIVES. Knight Orc is supplied on floppy disk, 
but we are pretty confident that it should work on other disk drives too.
(No promises! This is a free extra feature, so it's not a bug if the game 
won't work on your peculiar disk drive.) Level 9 have tested the game on 
both double-sided floppies and on our Winchester. Just copy the disks, file
by file, into a folder of your choice, and run it by clicking on GAME.PRG
and ignoring any initial error reported. Don't worry about duplicated 
files; they hold the same data on both release disks.  

Please remember that Knight Orc is protected by copyright and took a lot 
of man-years to produce, so only make one copy, for your own use, to keep 
only as long as you have the original game.

DESK ACCESSORIES. Knight Orc tries to grab as much memory as possible, for 
picture cache and oops buffers etc. And it maintains a split-screen. While
the game seems OK with some desk accessories in memory, we feel that trying
this is asking for trouble. Please either boot Knight Orc directly, or start
the ST with a boot disk that does not load unnecessary desk accessories.

Happy Adventuring!
