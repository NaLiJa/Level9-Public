[191:be more careful in future! ] 
[192:the picture stirs. Its surface ripples, the old man's figure 
swells out from the flat canvas and he steps forth to stand before 
you. 
% 
%He regards you solemnly, his long nose quivering with disapproval, 
"I am he whom the people of your benighted world name Father Time", 
he intones. "You have been chosen - though really, I fail to see why 
- to aid in the defence of history against the evil Timelords. 
They are nine in number, and all their will and power is bent to mould 
time for their own vile ends. Your task is to collect nine critical 
objects from Earth's history - each is marked with the Holy Hourglass 
- and place them in the cauldron at the end of Time. May Fortune smile 
upon you!" 
% 
%His message complete, Father Time steps back into the picture. ] 
[193:with a chorus of squeaks, mews, and barks, belling, chirruping, 
purring, and squealing, squiggling, wriggling, leaping and frolicking, 
the animals surge joyfully away. ] 
[194:the people are free! Couples long-separated rush to greet 
each other, children tear frantically into their parents' arms, 
the air is filled with the buzz of happy voices. Then by twos and 
threes and families they begin to leave the scene of their miserable 
confinement - but not before they have thanked you and rewarded 
you for their liberation. ] 
[195:the earth around the bottle is loosened. ] 
[196:it seems to be held fast. ] 
[197:%a skeletal hand, as cold as death and as strong as the very 
jaws of hell, clamps around your throat! ] 
[198:%a scorpion strikes with its deadly sting! ] 
[199:%lightning sears down and strikes you! ] 
[200:%with a puff of ancient smoke, Father Time appears.
% 
%He sneezes loudly, flapping his wizened hands ineffectually at 
the pallid vapour. "Nasty stuff". he mutters, then clears his throat 
and draws himself up his full height. "Do not be afraid!" he 
declaims nobly, ruining the effect by another fit of sneezing, 
"What you are about to - ashoo! - witness, is the future as it will 
be if the Timelords are victorious. Time grows short, yet there may 
still be enough to defeat them". He sniffs and blows his nose 
vigorously into a corner of his robe, then shuffles away.%]

[229:the clock strikes! Dust showers from the ceiling and the floor 
rocks beneath your feet. ] 
[230:there is a rumbling in the distance. Roiling clouds gather above 
and furry things start to rain down upon you; the spitting ones raking 
you with their claws as they pass, while the less-sharp ones growl 
ferociously. They all vanish with a "phut!" as soon as they hit the 
ground. A troop of pretty pink elephants stomp through the air from 
the east, the pounding of their feet keeping time with the thunder. 
Then, quite suddenly, they vanish and all is still and normal again. ] 
[231:you bump your nose painfully against the empty air. "Payment, 
please", chirps a mechanical voice. ] 
[232:"You are authorised to enter". ] 
[233:the cover of an inspection panel flips open, narrowly 
missing your face. ] 
[234:the cyberman's steely hand clamps onto your shoulder, digging 
into your flesh in an unfriendly manner as he flings you backwards. 
"Oh no you don't", he rasps ominously. ] 
[235:"Ta, love". ] 
[236:no one here wants] 
[237:you can't fill] 
[238:you can't empty] 
[239:YEUCH! No, you can't eat] 
[240:there's no one to give it to. ] 
[241:you find] 
[242:it's closed. ] 
[243:if you insist. There's no accounting for taste! ] 
[244:yum! ] 
[245:your vision clears and you realise that there is someone here! ] 
[246:something slaps the coin from your hand! ] 
[247:the fairy snatches it back, her delicate face contorted with 
fury. "You can't just TAKE it!" she trills venomously. "What do you 
think I am, a bleeding-heart charity, or something? I'm in this for 
what I can get and don't you forget it! The only way you're going to 
get a coin off me is to do it the proper way and give me a tooth 
first. Good grief!" She subsides into resentful muttering. ] 
[248:guess what? You can't - quite - reach the keys! ] 
[249:with a single mighty bound, the keys leap across to the 
magnetic lodestone and snuggle contentedly against it. ] 
[250:the tree's leaves rustle, and it gives a creaky groan. "Alas! 
Alas for my clear stream, and the sparkling waters which sang between 
my roots when the wood was young! Alas for the pretty Naiads who would 
play beneath my branches in the springtime! Alas for the shining fish, 
and their scales flashing in the sunlight! Alas for my croaking, 
hopping friends, who sang to me in the velvet midnight. Where have you 
gone, my children, my companions? Where have you gone? Driven away, 
all of you, by foul and frothing waters, the river waters that the 
Timelords poisoned. Oh, I am so lonely, and they have gone forever. 
Let me die, of your mercy, let me die". A thousand glinting teardrops 
tumble from its branches and soak into the ground. ]
[251:you need an axe. ] 
[252:that must be a good axe for, with one swift blow, you sever the 
tree's trunk and it falls with a peaceful sigh, to rest forever 
alongside its beloved stream. Looking down, you see that one of the 
iridescent teardrops remains, glistening at your feet. ] 
[253:the planks make a lovely splash, but they are too short to 
cross the stream. ] 
[254:you tie the planks together, making a longer plank. ] 
[255:the tied planks bridge the stream. ] 
[256:with what shall you tie them? ] 
[257:the stream is far too wide to cross without entering the 
water, and nobody in their right mind would try to swim through 
THAT yuck!" ] 
[258:you've done that already! ] 
[259:%you have no spear! The tiger growls deep in its throat 
with anticipation. Its great, red maw lolls open, it gives 
a yowling caterwaul - and attacks! ] 
[260:crackling ice radiates from the icicle as the super-cold lake 
water freezes around it. ] 
[261:petrol pours from the can and soaks into the ground. ] 
[262:you pour out the petrol and fling the can away. ] 
[263:the mammoth is blocking that route! You've really done it this 
time; you're trapped! ] 
[264:WHOOSH! The petrol burns away in a sheet of roaring flame! ] 
[265:the mammoth is so surprised that it jumps clean out of its skin 
and gallops off, goosebumps quivering. ] 
[266:you have no fire. ] 
[267:it burns brightly. ] 
[268:it's empty! ] 
[269:it burns well. ]

through the air. ] 
[282:the Black Knight redoubles his attacks! ] 
[283:Fortunately your armour deflects his blows. ] 
[284:with a heroic yell, the prince leaps to your defence ] 
[285:but, alas, he can find no sword and is cut down in moments. ] 
[286:and with one, mighty blow, slays the evil Black Knight. 
Carefully, he cleans his blade, nods to you, then hefts the body 
over his shoulder and carries it away. ] 
[287:you're in a hole. ] 
[288:you're in a deep hole. ]

[289:you're in a very deep hole which collapses, burying you alive! ] 
[290:Pirate Pete steals] 
[291:the lur booms out, its extraordinary harmonics reverberating 
through the air. It is answered by fierce shouts and yelling, 
the stamp of marching feet and the rattle of many weapons. A 
dozen Vikings surge into view. ] 
[292:when they discover that Pirate Pete is not here, their fury 
knows no bounds! ] 
[293:they fall upon the pirate and bind his hands tightly. Then, 
tying a rope around his neck, the Vikings lead him away, pausing 
only to hand you an olive branch, with their thanks. ] 
[294:the Viking is delighted by the warm fur. He throws it over 
his shoulders and prances around, admiring himself in the 
polished surface of his shield. He gives you his lur in exchange. 
"There is a reward for capturing the pirate", he says. ] 
[295:it's very hot. ] 
[296:you'll die without water! ] 
[297:the heat becomes overpowering! ] 
[298:the lion struggles free from the net. ] 
[299:with a fierce roar, the lion attacks! ] 
[300:glistening tears rain down from the willow tree. ] 
[301:the tree is dead. ] 
[302:planks bridge the stream. ] 
[303:there's a hole to the south. ] 
[304:the wood burns warmly, sending out puffs of pleasantly-scented 
smoke. ] 
[305:the dinosaur approaches menacingly, shaking the ground with 
every step of its gigantic feet. ] 
[306:a secret door leads east. ] 
[307:in case you hadn't noticed, the plant is eating YOU! ] 
[308:I didn't expect that! ] 
[309:the Timelords realise they are not alone and rise to their feet, 
their eighteen evil eyes stabbing into you. Your world spins and 
fades.. ] 
[310:releasing liquid paraquat. ] 
[311:the plant gives a little whimper and shrivels into a wrinkled 
mess. ] 
[312:the dogs notice you and growl quietly. ] 
[313:the dogs gain confidence and start barking for real, "WOOF! WOOF! 
YAP! GRRR!" ] 
[314:"ARF! ARF! ARF! AOOOUL!" A platoon of guards, finally alerted by 
all the barking, piles into the room and grab you. ] 
[315:you feel VERY strong indeed! ] 
[316:that was just what you needed! ] 
[317:and, with terrified yells, the cavemen scamper off in every 
direction. ] 
[318:it wanders away] 
[319:from the debris appears] 
[320:the air shimmers. ] 
[321:the dinosaur stomps up: one, two, three, SQUELCH... ] 
[322:the killer dinosaurs meet, stare furiously and leap for each 
others' throats, bellowing with rage. They certainly aren't worried 
about puny humans any more! You hug the ground as they grapple and 
roll into the distance. ] 
[323:the dinosaur executes a stately, hundred-ton sidestep and 
blocks your path. ] 
[324:the ice cube shatters, freeing the Snow Queen. "Thank you". 
she breathes, her voice as lilting as the cold winds which play 
among the glimmering snow vaults of Seracia. She takes a 
finely-wrought sword from beneath the folds of her robe, 
touches both your shoulders lightly with its glinting blade, 
and glides away. ] 
[325:the ice wall shatters, tinkling melodically as it falls. ] 
[326:Mmmmmm! ] 
[327:only a real dodo would kiss ] 
[328:there is a puff of slimy smoke and the frog turns into a
handsome prince. He sneezes a couple of times. "Ghastly smoke 
they use round here" he remarks chattily. ] 
[329:nice try, but the icicle is out of reach. ] 
[330:the din shakes the icicle loose. ] 
[331:noisy little beggar, aren't you! ] 
[332:the bad tooth comes loose easily and drops into your hand. 
The tiger beams happily, rubs its head affectionately against 
your leg, and trots away. ] 
[333:it has a lean and hungry look, and could be in pain. Be careful! ] 
[334:the tiger is friendly now, but seems to be in a great deal of 
pain. ] 
[335:the tiger purrs deafeningly. ] 
[336:the tiger gingerly touches its puffy cheek with one long, 
curving claw. ] 
[337:the tiger winces and gives a little, moaning roar. ] 
[338:the fox grabs the bone and slinks off, leaving you thinking 
uncharitable thoughts about traps and the current market value of 
silver fox furs. ] 
[339:the fox nips in frdragon lets you climb on to his shoulders and you flap 
merrily back the way you came until you reach the edge of a wide 
moat surrounded by a high, turfed bank. The dragon tries to fly 
over it, but he is, unfortunately, a very SMALL genuine 
fire-breathing dragon, and not really equipped for this sort of 
thing. He gives a despairing whimper (incinerating a couple of 
wasps and a bluebottle who had been dreamily tootling along 
wondering where to stand for dinner), and belly-flops 
into the water.dragon lets you climb on to his shoulders and you flap

wasps and a bluebottle who had been dreamily tootling along 
wondering where to stand for dinner), and belly-flops 
into the water. There is a horrible hissing noise, strongly 
reminiscent of an awful lot of water being poured over hot 
coals, and a soggy cloud of black smoke and steam squelches to 
the bank. The dragon coughs and slinks away miserably. ] 
[347:"I think I'll go for a little fly now, to work this lot off. 
Would you like to come along for a ride?" ] 
[348:the dragon eats the food ravenously, apparently oblivious to 
the gouts of flame which periodically belch from his mouth. 
"Thanks pal, that was delish". he says finally. "Could have done 
with a bit more charcoal and mustard, though". ] 
[349:the android exchanges your coin for a galactic groat. ] 
[350:the tooth fairy examines it closely and says, "This isn't our 
usual kind of tooth. It's huge!" Her eyes flicker as she continues, 
"Tell you what, I'll swap it for one silver coin. Is that a deal?" ] 
[351:"Mmm. Well, perhaps I could throw in a firefly as well. OK?" ] 
[352:"You greedy human! I withdraw my offer! You'll just get the coin 
think yourself lucky". ] 
[353:%the fairy takes your tooth and flits away, giggling so hard 
that it crosses your mind to wonder whether the dear little soul 
may have just ripped you off. ] 
[354:the tiger gulps down the food greedily and purrs at you. ] 
[355:the brontosaurus grabs the leaves and jerks them into the air, 
carrying you out of the pit! ] 
[356:the innkeeper's eyes light up as he struggles to lift the gold. 
"OK", he says nonchalantly, "I'm robbing myself really, but I'll let 
you take the ale if you want". ] 
[357:the innkeeper snorts rudely, "That's not worth nearly enough!" ] 
[358:"Thank you, thank you, thank you a thousand times, good 
traveller!" says the messenger, gulping at the ale. "Methought I 
was nigh spent from thirst". He drinks every last drop and 
gratefully shares some of his food with you. ] 
[359:the Jester capers madly with glee. "A million thanks, good 
traveller". he chortles. Taking off his motley cap, he throws it 
to you, bells gaily jingling, and skips off into the distance. ] 
[360:the narcissus squeals with pleasure and flips you an 
unprepossessing hunk of lodestone. It wanders away,  
admiring its reflection in the looking glass. ] 
[361:the dogs gulp down the delicacies, wag their tails and 
waddle off for a nap. ] 
[362:what a queer thing to do to ]

the most hugest emerald you have ever seen. Well, really, let's 
face it, more-or-less the only emerald you've ever seen - and you 
can't count the ones in the Tower of London, because they're all 
fakes. It's still a pretty big emerald, though - about an inch 
across, and engraved with a portrait of Cleopatra. ] ; emerald

[682:the figurine has been skillfully carved into the shape of a 
pouncing tiger, the stripes in the stone cleverly mimicking those 
of a real tiger. Tiny green stones glint in its eyesockets and 
its mouth is opened in a silent roar. ] ; onyx figurine 
;
[683:it's an unusual firefly this one, because it gives forth a 
steady light, not a series of flashes like most fireflies. Also it 
can sing a whole three notes from Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring", 
which is quite an achievement for a half-inch beetle - and the 
firefly knows it, so it sings them over and over and over again, ad 
nauseum. It's very irritating! ] ; firefly

[684:black spiced bread from the kitchens of the Masterchefs of 
Mudsplot, with a fine selection of local pickles - pickled 
garlic, pickled pigs' trotters, pickled newts' tongues, 
pickled sticklebacks, and, for a very special treat, toads' 
warts in aspic. ] ; food

[687:it is hard, ring-patterned and thin-bladed, with straight 
edges and a slightly-rounded point. The hilt is built up around 
the tang, which is one with the blade, and the grip is of 
polished bone bound with leather strips and silver wire. 
The pommel is gold-chased and ornamented, and embellished with 
a small gold ring. The whole thing is perfectly balanced for 
battle. ] ; sharp sword

pictures of a narcissus carved by an unpractised hand. ] ; lodestone

[689:it is skillfully-made from bronze, and very old: it

cannot identify, with gilded straps to hold the foot in place at 
toe and heel, and longer straps which are apparently intended to 
be entwined around the ankle and calf. Small iridescent 
befeathered wings sprout from the heel-guards, trembling slightly 
as if they are alive. The sandals are obviously magical - wear

[705:not the most usual of objects to find. It is quite small 
and gleams dully, like a poor-quality opal. Suddenly, it begins 
to whimper in a shrill, bell-like voice. "Oh dear, oh dear, 
don't look at me, please, oh, I must look frightful..". it 
subsides for a few moments, then continues: "You should have seen 
me when I was at my zenith! Oh, my dear, all the young planets 
were positively clamouring for my autograph, I can tell you. 
I'll never forget the night I made my debut in the Snotgurgle 
system. The poor things had been in darkness for absolutely 
centuries, and it really must have been wonderful for them to 
see me shining so brightly in the sky. Right at the edge of the 
Galaxy, too, so you can imagine how dismal it was for them there, 
poor lambs. My dear, they positively worshipped me!... But then 
this devastatingly gorgeous comet introduced me to angel dust. I 
know I shouldn't have taken it, of course, but I was young, and 
foolish and at the peak of my career, and, really, it was the 
most tremendous fun. And then I started arriving late 
in the mornings, which upset everybody no end, and a few times I 
just didn't bother to go in at night at all, which I suppose was 
the final straw as far as the Powers That Be are concerned. So 
they kicked me out, and - here I am". It lapses into silence, 
sniffling miserably. ] ; fallen star

[707:a very lethal weapon. There's a lot of fuss about them in 
your own time - or, at least, about some kind of trident. This 
one has three barbed prongs, a seaweedy design running along the 
haft, and feels a bit slimy to the touch. ] ; trident 
;
[708:not very large, it bears a picture of an expressionless 
Japanese lady clad in a flowery kimono, with a pincushion-thing on 
her head from which dangle an assortment of bells, tassles and 
little shiny silver things. She is sitting under a graceful cherry 
tree, fanning herself. Behind her, mist-shrouded mountains rise 
into a pale sky. ] ; vase

[709:it has long since lost any trace of healthy white enamel; it 
is a dull grey, with nasty brown areas that look none too savoury.

^N tank. All is well with the world]

^N rushes on the floor smell faintly of ^N mould and old food, and the 
^N furniture is of dark, carved ^N oak] 
[3403:, which smells of old ^N wood, ^N dust and ^N cobwebs. It is 
very gloomy and cramped] 
[3404: which bends to the southwest. The ^N grassy ^N lawns 
beside the drive are edged with the ^N vibrant ^N colours of 
^N summer ^N flowers. A ^N narrow ^N country ^N road runs 
north-south and the buzzing of ^N bees fills the warm air] 
[3405:. A ^N red-and-white ^N striped ^N barrier bars the way to some

of ^N red and ^N white ^N roses. ^N Fragrant ^N herbs grow beneath its

^N beams of ^N sunlight play upon the ^N rich ^N blue ^N treads, and

[3409: at the ^N top of the ^N stairs, where all is still and

[3410:; along with ^N fifty-seven ^N spiders and a ^N dead ^N mouse. 
The ^N shelves seem to be empty and the air is dank and chill] 
[3411:. A ^N mighty ^N four-poster ^N bed stands in the centre of the

^N plants grow in ^N strange, ^N distorted ^N shapes, as though 
writhing in pain] 
[3420: whose ^N timbers are pungent with ^N sun-heated ^N creosote. 
^N Ants run busily up and down its ^N sides] 
[3421:, among a ^N jumble of ^N old ^N boots, bits of ^N rotten 
^N timber, ^N broken ^N tools and ^N rusty ^N tins full of ^N nails 
that nobody will ever use. It is stiflingly hot] 
[3422:, its ^N oily ^N surface swirling. Occasionally, a ^N bubble 
glops to the surface and bursts with a noxious smell]

^N Blades of ^N grass and ^N sweet-smelling ^N camomile grow in the 
^N cracks between the ^N stones]

^N stones cracked and flaking]

^N Dark, ^N oily ^N marks stain the ^N dry ^N ground, and there is a

[3426:. The ^N sky is very ^N grey and an icy wind howls 
dejectedly across the ^N glacier, its gusts like icy needles 
against your skin. ^N Fell ^N voices echo from the ^N faraway 
^N hills] 
[3427:, whose ^N treacherous ^N pits and ^N ridges are hidden beneath a 
^N light ^N dusting of ^N snow] 
[3428:, whose ^N sheer ^N surface seems to slither away beneath your 
feet, as though alive] 
[3429:, where ^N drifting ^N snow has banked up at the ^N foot 
of the ^N mountains, making walking a misery. It reaches up to 
your thighs, dragging at your legs with icy hands as you flounder 
through it] 
[3430:, snaking across the ^N steep, ^N white ^N slopes in ^N icy, 
^N hairpin ^N curves] 
[3431:, your fingers and toes numb with cold. Your hands are 
bruised from bashing against ^N stones as you scrabble for a hold, 
and your feet continually slide out from under you on the ^N icy

[3440: where ^N ice has grown into ^N fantastic ^N shapes of 
^N flowers, ^N animals and ^N hoary ^N faces] 
[3441: melted from ^N slushy ^N black ^N ice, and filled with 
the "plink - plink - plink" of dripping water] 
[3442:, amid ^N tall, ^N snow-laden ^N trees, bowed down 
beneath their chilly burden. Every now and then, a ^N branch rids 
itself of its load of ^N snow with a soft "flump"] 
[3443:, filled with ^N carefully-tended ^N plants. Here are 
^N silver-furry ^N eidelweiss and ^N radiant ^N blue ^N gentians, 
^N delicate ^N violets and ^N tiny ^N yellow irises; ^N tall 
^N foxgloves with ^N tiny, ^N brown-spotted, ^N white-and-gold 
^N flowers, and a ^N delicate, ^N purple ^N primula] 
[3444:. A ^N crack in the ^N ice leads south. A ^N tiny ^N gilded 
^N throne, studded with ^N diamonds, stands at one end; and ^N graceful 
^N pillars curve up to the ^N vaulted ^N roof, barely ten feet high] 
[3445:, whose ^N translucent ^N walls contain a ^N pallid ^N heart of 
^N fire] 
[3446:, their ^N cold ^N fires dimmed] 
[3447:, like a forgotten echo of former fires] 
[3448:, with a ^N passage leading downwards] 
[3449: rising from a ^N lush ^N green ^N grassy ^N valley. There 
is an ^N opening in the ^N hillside. Far to the east is a 
^N watering ^N hole, surrounded by ^N grazing ^N animals. 
A hazy shimmer of heat rises above the plain] 
[3450:. The ^N grazing ^N animals watch you with interest: some 
of them look very ^N large] 
[3451:. The ^N grazing ^N dinosaurs ^N walk slowly away as you 
approach, their lumbering feet making the ground shake] 
[3452:. The sun beats warm upon youN smoke] 
[3459:, filled with ^N roughly-cured ^N hides, ^N deers' ^N antlers 
and ^N large ^N chalk-covered ^N nodules of ^N unworked ^N flint] 
[3460:. The ^N cavemen have obviously been very busy here, as there

[3461: where the ^N cave people make cheap gifts for barter

[3463:. Clearly ^N minimalism is all the rage, and ^N matchstalk 
^N men chase ^N matchstalk ^N mammoths across the walls]

[3465:. Skeleton ^N heads hang from the ^N walls - some of them 
^N human] 
[3466:, an ^N echoing ^N limestone ^N chamber] 
[3467: over an ^N exceedingly ^N deep ^N crevasse; its timbers 
groan beneath your weight] 
[3468:. You find a ^N cartoon of a ^N man in a ^N bath on one ^N wall, 
and find the ^N cryptic ^N slogan, "backwardness can make rueful"] 
[3469:: "JWAAMTETS (5,4 inventor)" is inscribed high on one ^N wall, 
and the rest of the contents are equally incomprehensible] 
[3470: which sounds hollow underfoot] 
[3471:. ^N High ^N stone ^N walls block the ^N view to east 
and west, and its surface is dusty and strewn with stones] 
[3472:] 
[3473:. To the north is a little ^N mediaeval ^N ale-house 
with ^N wattled ^N walls and a ^N thatched ^N roof] 
[3474: a ^N grubby ^N room with ^N straw on the ^N floor; and 
a liberal spattering of ^N rat ^N droppings on the ^N stained ^N bar 
^N top - not at all the sort of ^N place you usually frequent] 
[3475: leading past a ^N dense ^N copse to a ^N splendid 
^N castle visible in the east, its ^N grey ^N stone ^N walls shining 
in the ^N afternoon ^N sun] 
[3476:. There are ^N pillories and a pair of ^N stocks, 
surrounded by a ^N jeering ^N crowd, who are happily lobbing 
rotten ^N tomatoes, ^N eggs, ^N hard ^N green ^N apples and anything else 
they can get their hands on] 
[3477:. The ^N drawbridge is raised and the ^N moat looks extremely 
deep and smelly] 
[3478:, which has been invaded by ^N tangled ^N masses of ^N rhododendron 
that makes movement difficult] 
; 
[3480:. The ^N dense ^N tangle of ^N twigs and ^N branches catches in 
your clothes and pulls your hair] 
[3481:, struggling through the ^N tangled ^N undergrowth, your hands 
scratched and bleeding] 
; 
[3483: below the south ^N bank of the ^N moat, savouring the

[3484:, between two ^N tall ^N battle-scarred ^N towers. The 
^N sinister ^N mouth of a ^N murder ^N hole opens in the ^N arch 
above your head, and the ^N cold ^N grey ^N stones are dank and 
forbidding] 
[3485:. ^N Battered ^N armour and ^N notched ^N swords litter the 
^N blood-soaked ^N ground. The ^N Keep stands open to the southeast, 
and the air is unnaturally still] 
[3486:, a long, ^N high-ceilinged ^N room with a ^N stone ^N flagged 
^N floor] 
[3487:at the ^N Keep ^N entrance. There is a ^N hole in one

quarters can be secretly vetted] 
[3488:, ^N piled ^N high with ^N kegs and ^N barrels and filled 
with the ^N slightly ^N sour ^N scent of old wine] 
[3489:. A ^N sweet ^N scent rises as you crush the ^N rushes

[3490:, shrouded in darkness] 
[3491:, which shine with moisture and are stained with ^N patches of 
^N livid ^N green ^N algae] 
[3492:, which are dismal, ^N dank and ^N depressing. There's 
a ^N red ^N cross on the ^N wall and the ^N earth ^N floor

[3493: in a ^N small ^N bay surrounded by ^N overhanging ^N cliffs. 
^N Breakers ^N roll in from the ^N sea to the north, rocking the

[3566:]
[3567:, a long ^N sparkling ^N pathway which soars upwards 
into ^N space] 
[3568: and the ^N star-fields glimmer all around you] 
[3569:, amid a sea of ^N brig[3577:, splashing around on a ^N colossal water ^N drop 
which wobbles around uncertainly in mid-air] 
[3578:, surrounded by ^N instrument ^N panels and lots of 
flashing lights] 
[3579: which was left when a few hundred tonnes of classified

[3586:, designed for low-grav manoeuvres] 
[3587: with ^N clear ^N blue water and ^N exotic ^N plastic ^N plants] 
[3588: between a ^N ladder and a ^N low ^N tunnel]
[3589: which has an empty smell of hot people and floor polish. 
^N Racks of ^N foils, ^N rapiers and other ^N swords line the walls] 
[3590:, surrounded by all kinds of ^N electrical and ^N solid-state 
^N junk, most of which are beyond your comprehension] 
[3591:. ^N Butterflies flitter happily in the ^N bright ^N sunshine 
and a ^N heady ^N perfume fills the air. You could be in ^N paradise. 
You could also be excused for thinking it's too good to be true] 
[3592:: "ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE" it declares, in 
friendly red-neon letters] 
[3593:. Where trees and grasses once grew is now a ^N smouldering 
^N wasteland and the ^N sun hangs low: a ^N huge ^N ball of molten 
^N red ^N fire. The heat is terrible and the ^N ground below your 
feet quivers as though in agony]
[3594: of a ^N small ^N village, its ^N pathetic ^N remains hiding 
who-knows-what tragedies] 
[3595:, which plunges into darkness] 
[3596:. The walls are too crumbly to climb]
[3597: of ^N decayed earthy ^N passages, their walls pallid 
with ^N mould] 
[3598: that glows faintly with a sickly light] 
[3599:, each adding its own contribution to the general stench] 
[3600:, some sort of ^N experimental ^N laboratory, filled with 
^N incomprehensible ^N equipment. It smells of rotten eggs and sulphur] 
[3601:, dirty, as well as smelly] 
[3602: which ^N grab at you. One ^N flower is particularly 
^N enormous] 
[3603:. ^N Sharp ^N hairs block your escape and the ^N walls 
ooze ^N digestive ^N juices]
[3604:, lined with ^N hairs that make good ^N stepping-stones] 
[3605:]
[3606:]
[3607:. ^N Crude ^N steps lead upwards]
[3608:]
[3609:, between ^N jagged, ^N constricting ^N walls] 
[3610:. You can feel a trapdoor above, through which comes 
a faint burr of conversation] ;don't mark trapdoor
[3611:, though you cannot see their ^N faces, having only a 
wonderful view of their ^N knees, or ^N tentacles, as the case may be] 
[3612: as they discuss their wicked plans. They are of different 
races and species, and probably from different planets. 
Some look like lizards, another like a dog. Two bear more 
relation to giant squids than anything else, and one is a 
heap of green slime that glurbles and splots on the table]
[3613:. Nasty cold things squiggle and squirm beneath your groping 
fingers] 
[3614:, covered with ^N putrescent ^N weeds] 
[3615:, hung with ^N ancient, ^N clinging ^N cobwebs]

[3618:. It fades into mist in the east]
