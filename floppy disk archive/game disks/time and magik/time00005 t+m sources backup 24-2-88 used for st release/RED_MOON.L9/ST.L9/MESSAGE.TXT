[200:the dulcimer takes control and plays a hauntingly beautiful 
melody. ] 
[201:as you pick up the crystal, two dragons appear from the side 
rooms. They lumber crabwise across the floor and circle you 
menacingly, cutting off any escape. ] 
; 
[219:it's made of iron. ] 
[220:all the aches and pains - even ones you didn't know you 
had - drop from your body and you feel more agile than you have 
ever done before! ] 
[221:as the raisin hits the ground it explodes in a blinding fury of 
light! When your vision clears, you see that it has been 
transformed into a glowing sphere that bobs along in the air 
just a few feet from your head. %] 
[222: hit point remaining. %] 
[223:congratulations! You have completed your quest, restored the Red Moon, 
and saved the Kingdom of Baskalos! %] 
[224:the mummy hauls itself upright and shambles towards you, rotten 
bandages trailing and empty mouth ajar. A weird green light shines from 
its eye sockets! %] 
[225:with a "phut", and a whiff of garlic, the book vanishes! %] 
[226:"Phut!" A book appears! - and so does a strong smell of garlic. %] 
; 
[228:nice try. ] 
[229:you see only darkness. %] 
[230:Welcome to Red Moon, the second part of Time and Magik, 
copyright (C) 1988 from Level 9 Computing and Mandarin. 
% 
%In the parallel realm of Baskalos, the arcane arts mirror our 
technology. At the time when the the Red Moon crystal was the sole 
active source of magik, its theft was a potential disaster for the 
history of both worlds. You must recover it...%] 
[231:you hear nothing special. ] 
[232:a fleet of small slimy things pop into existence and lollop 
across the floor, chanting a chorus from Der Rosenkavalier in high, 
croaky voices. Then they vanish as suddenly as they came. ] 
[233:time goes by. Ho hum] 
[234:no one here wants ] 
[235:yeuch! No thanks! ] 
[236:it opens. ] 
[237:it closes. ] 
[238:I didn't expect that. ] 
[239:you're dead and stand on the dismal plain of Limbo, amid shapes 
of grey and insubstantial smoke. %] 
[240:then a cheerless voice intones: ] 
[241:"I suppose you want to live again. They all do. Can't see 
why. Miserable thing, life... Well? Answer Yes or NO". ] 
[242:"Will yrom nowhere, a sepulchral, hollow voice intones, "Humakaat". %] 
[256:a sibilant voice hisses from nowhere, "Satarh". %] 
[257:you hear a bolt slide back with a dull "thunk". ] 
; 
[259:it is firmly, and magically, sealed. ] 
[260:Wirts mirt mud? ] 
[261:] 
[262:what with? ] 
[263:a heavy metal gate clangs ominously shut behind you. ] 
[264:the gate firmly bars the entrance. ] 
[265:But, fortunately, it is open. ]
[266:"Oh *@!!*! - not another puling adventurer!" he thunders, 
"I had hoped for srom nowhere, a sepulchral, hollow voice intones, "Humakaat". %]

[266:"Oh *@!!*! - not another puling adventurer!" he thunders, 
"I had hoped for some entertainment, a few moments of refinement; 
perhaps a madrigal or two... but I get THIS!" ] ; assuming it's BOSTOG 
; the dwarf speaking 
[267:the gate will never close again. ] 
[268:the gate creaks open and the key falls away, 
disintegrating in a shower of rusty flakes. ] 
[269:the handle fits into the hole perfectly and there is a 
faint click as it slots firmly into place. ] 
[270:the handle cranks round and round, slowly opening the great 
sluices that confine the murky waters of the reservoir. ] 
[271:the glowing sphere wobbles a little in the air, then floats away! %] 
; 
[273:lake ] 
[274:no thanks! That water's nine-tenths noxious brown sludge, 
liberally seasoned with green slime! ] 
[275:as the door closes, it merges invisibly with the wall, until 
no mortal eye could detect its presence. %] 
[276:you slide helplessly down a precipitate chute, which closes
tightly behind you. %] 
[277:you plunge headlong to the rocks below. ] 
[278:there's a trapdoor hidden beneath the beans! ] 
[279:the Guardian reaches out and thrusts you bodily into the maze. %]
[280:your breath runs out and, lungs burning, you swim back rather 
than drown. %]
[281:you are swimming easily underwater, with all the facility and 
skill of a lifetime's practice. It is as if this is your natural 
element. %]
[282:your lungs are on fire! You can't breathe underwater! %] 
[283:the grill is blocking the way up. %] 
[284:you prise the grill free and it falls down the chimney, 
rattling against the sooty sides until it lands with a dull clang, 
far below. %] 
[285:you are attacked by ] 
[286:but manage to dodge. %] 
[287:doing ] ; followed by number, so need succeeding space. 
[288: points of damage. ] 
[289:your strength gives out. %] 
[290:the blow smashes against your shield, its force absorbed by 
the doughty wood] 
[291:but it is one blow too many: rivets pop and the bronze boss 
falls away. The shield collapses into a heap of shivered wood. %] 
[292:your armour takes the impact of the blow, absorbing its 
force against its metal rings] 
[293:but is rendered useless. %] 
[294:gallantly, you attack] 
[295:you strike at] 
[296:wildly, you charge at] 
[297:who neatly sidesteps, dodging your blow. %] 
[298:you have slain] 
[299:with a disease spell. ] 
[300:by throwing some mummy's dust. ] 
[301:with a fireball] 
[302:with a lightning bolt] 
[303:with magical flames] 
[304:with his fangs] 
[305:with its bandages] 
[306:you have ] ; number 
[307: hit points left. %] 
[308:you can't go that way - the exit is blocked by your opponent. ] 
[309:you turn tail and flee - but not quite fast enough! ] 
[310:the sarcophagus creaks open, to reveal a well-preserved mummy, 
wrapped in ancient cerecloths, with a brooch lying upon its breast. %] 
[311:the mummy's body seems to slump, then it collapses into 
itself and crumbles away, until only a pile of dust is left. %] 
[312:your incantation lacks power and sounds as feeble as 
moonshine at noon. ] 
[313:nothing happens. You lack the proper focus for that spell. ] 
[314:the presence of iron inhibits your magic, leaving you filled 
with the frustration of power inchoate. %] 
[315:the room is plunged into darkness - and for the space of seven 
heartbeats you can see nothing save the phantom images at the back of 
your eyes. %] 
[316:you fail. %] 
[317:the burning sword sears your hand! With a yell of pain, you 
drop it. ] 
[318:what about the fire, huh? It's kinda hot!] 
[319:Huh? I see no liquid. ] 
[320:you've already done that. %] 
[321:the water slops out. ] 
[322:brim-full of water. ] 
[323:"If you let me live I will let you have these spices", Ziix 
whines. %] 
[324:you hear ] 
[325:a quiet whirring. ] 
[326:a soft click. ] 
[327:the whisper of a closing catch. ] 
[328:the magnet attracts the coins, and with a clank they leap 
through the air to cleave to its surface. ] 
[329:as the safe turns round, you can see that its back is missing! 
On its top shelf, among the dust and cobwebs, was a box. ] 
[330:your mind's pening it triggers a jet 
of poison, hidden in the velvet lining, which squirts into your face! %] 
[334:your mask saves you, the poison splashing harmlessly off its 
surface. %]
[335:Xiiz demands that you give him a treasure before he will let 
you pass. %]
[336:Xiiz dashes your worthless offering to one side, growling with 
anger. %] 
[337:grudgingly, Xiiz accepts your payment. %] 
[338:the object is] 
[339:valuable. ] 
[340:worthless. ] 
[341:normal. ] 
[342:magic. ] 
[343:your spell hits] pening it triggers a jet 
of poison, hidden in the velvet lining, which squirts into your face! %] 
[334:your mask saves you, the poison splashing harmlessly off its 
surface. %]
[335:Xiiz demands that you give him a treasure before he will let 
you pass. %]
[336:Xiiz dashes your worthless offering to one side, growling with

[337:grudgingly, Xiiz accepts your payment. %] 
[338:the object is] 
[339:valuable. ] 
[340:worthless. ] 
[341:normal. ] 
[342:magic. ] 
[343:your spell hits] 
[344:you bounce back up, unharmed. ] 
[345:your spell works. ] 
[346:the air around you begins to glow with a radiant pink 
light - you are surrounded by a magic aura. %] 
[347:you feel stronger. %] 
[348:that spell will only affect a sentient target. %] 
[349:for a short time, your steps feel buoyant and somehow more 
springy, but it is not long before you return to normal. ] 
[350:the presence of another living being disrupts the spell, 
sending coruscating fireworks of magik whizzing through the air. %] 
[351:your magic shield gives a sad little moan and pops out of 
existence! %] 
[352:your strength spell comes to an end. %] 
[353: point of damage. %] 
[354:no damage. %] 
[355:your lamp is still alight! %] 
[356:you lose your grip and tumble helplessly down the well. %] 
[357:the door is too small for you to pass through! %] 
[358:you are falling, tumbling helplessly over and over, falling, 
falling... %] 
[359:"Oh it's you. Push off before I lose my temper!"%] 
[360:"Go away. I'm busy."%] 
[361:"Cretinous adventurer! What are you, lost or something?'%] 
[362:Xiiz says ] 
[363:as you enter, a perfect copy of yourself flicks into existence 
and advances, eyes glittering, to the attack! %] 
[364:you are surrounded by thousands of brilliant flashing 
lights, which dazzle your eyes and effectively blind you. %] 
[365:you can't see to move because of the lights. %] 
[366:the coins have been pushed under the grate, well out of 
your reach. %] 
[367:the pool of acid is blocking that exit. %] 
[368:for a few moments, the pool fizzles frantically, then becomes 
still. The chalk and the acid have reacted together to form a 
harmless solution. %] 
[369:carefully, you conceal the pills in the meat. %] 
[370:yeuch! Dog food! %] 
[371:the dog wolfs the meat down as if it hasn't had a decent 
meal in weeks. %] 
[372:seconds later it dies. And quite right too - there are far too 
many dogs around, and owners never clean up after their pests. ] 
[373:the dog is standing guard over that door, its fur bristling, 
and a low growl issuing from its foaming jaws. %] 
[374:zzzzzammo! A hefty electric shock sizzles through your 
body and you leap back, quivering. Coils of smoke drift up from 
the charred patches in your clothes. ] 
[375:Kellf gulps the drink down in one long swallow. His thirst 
quenched, he thanks you gravely, and to repay you tells you that 
he has heard a rumour that mummies can only be slain by magic. 
Then, thanking you again, he takes his leave and shambles away. %] 
[376:Kellf is dying of thirst! %] 
[377:] 
[378:the armour has a lot of sharp edges and is painful to wear. 
Dashed cold, too. %] 
[379:Nezzon's eyes gleam: "Goods for barter! Goods for trade!" 
she exclaims, "Many have need of my wares when a-questing, 
adventurer, so buy now while you have the chance!"%] 
[380:"Hmmph! You'll need give me more than that, in exchange for 
all my stock", Nezzon says, nettled. %] 
[381:"A fair trade!" Nezzon says, grinning. She slaps the palm of 
your hand and indicates that you should do the same to her. 
"So, our bargain is sealed". She winks jovially and saunters off 
to fiddle with a mortar and pestle at the other end of the room, 
indicating that you should leave. %] 
[382:you find a carved acorn among the leaves. %] 
[383:as you read the scroll the acorn expands, arcing up through 
the air, across and down again, forming a bridge over the chasm. %] 
; 
[385:Nezzon says ominously, "I'm not just giving them away, adventurer".%] 
[386:Nezzon laughs unpleasantly, "Come on, let's have something in 
exchange. I'm not in business for my health, you know!" %] 
[387:Nezzon wants some kind of payment, and she's fingering the 
knife at her belt!.. %] 
[388:you feel stronger, but find you can't take them off again! %] 
[389:you are wearing a pair of permanent bracers. %] 
[390:the vampire cowers back, held at bay and unable to attack because 
of the crucifix. %] 
[391:the vampire melts and shrivels away; dying by the light of the 
raisin sun. %] 
[392lames. Through the conflagration, you can just make 
out their bulky figures staggering backwards. %] 
[399:"Ah, it is good to meet a mortal with some culture! Most of 
them are such miserably vulgar beings that it makes me quite 
depressed to think about it. Allow me to contribute my poor mite to 
your quest - even though it is bound to be hopeless - and 
tell you that there is a spell hidden in these caves 
which can turn an acorn into a bridge". Bostog's mouth writhes 
briefly and you realize thalames. Through the conflagration, you can just make 
out their bulky figures staggering backwards. %]

briefly and you realize that he is trying to smile, an exercise 
to which he is almost entirely unaccustomed. "I must go now", 
he says dejectedly. "I won't bid you farewell, because you probably 
won't. Nobody ever does in these caves". And he shuffles away, 
humming a whimsical little dirge. ]

[630:they are solid and heavy and impressed with complicated 
hallmarks, of which the only recognizable symbol is a rampant eagle. 
They are very valuable] ; silver bars
; 
[631:it is a beautiful thing, shaped like a flying insect. The 
segments of its body are in three different shades of gold, 
while its wings are inlaid with an iridescent patina of deep 
green stone that shines like a raven's wing. Its eyes are two 
sparkling pieces of rose-cut pyrite] ; brooch 
; 
[632:these are an unusual form of coinage, rarely used in 
human societies. They are very heavy, with complicated, and 
apparently meaningless, patterns etched on their faces. Each one 
has a neat hole bored through its middle] ; iron coins 
; 
[633:it is not one of the clumsy modern things with mismatched, over-sized 
stones and yards of velvet and fur, but a real old crown, such as were 
made when the world was young. It has slender gold links, forged 
by a master smith into a delicate chain, interrupted every now and 
then by a spray of golden flowers: forget-me-nots, hare bells and 
speedwell, their tiny petals picked out with many-shaded blue 
stones, and in the heart of each, a glimmering yellow topaz] ; crown
; 
[634:it is of solid gold, inlaid with some black stuff which throws 
into relief the outlandish design raised upon its surface] ; medallion

[635:it is magnificent, a shimmering fall of diamonds set in 
platinum, the blue fire of their facets sending rainbow lights 
dancing on your face and hands] ; necklace
; 
[636:for centuries, pearls like this have been called 'black', 
but as you study it you can see that this is not true. It is the 
colour of gun metal, and has a nacreous lustre of rainbow colours 
that slide fluidly across its perfect surface] ; pearl
; 
[637:it is not very large, but of fine quality, a subtle leaf-green 
square-cut that glimmers with the pale light of sunshine, seen 
through a canopy of summer leaves] ; emerald
; 
[638:it is the Codex Oedipus. It is bound in dark tooled leather and 
its pages are of thick, creamy paper which give off a pleasant 
musty smelolished wood. Carved into its surface is a finely-executed 
picture of a bridge] ; acorn

firmly attached to a polished bamboo handle. It is painted with a 
pastoral scene of wizened peasants slaving in the paddy fields] ; fan

[647:it is quite a large horseshoe, the kind you might expect to see 
on a cart horse, except that somebody has covered it in fetching blue 
velvet embroidered with the legend "Good Luck" in cheap gold 
thread] ; horse shoe

head liberally daubed with splodgy red spots. Its underside is a 
sickly shade of yellow and it smells of treacle tart] ; mushroom
; 
[649:they are very, very pretty - like those little sugar-coated 
chocolate sweets - they smell delicious and every single one of 
them has "Poison" written across it in bright red letters] ; pills
; 
[650:a small green-clad imp appears from nowhere and kicks you in 
the shins to attract your attention. "I shouldn't take more than 
one sip of that stuff, if I were you", he pipes. "I did once, and 
it turned me into a pot of petunias for three-and-a-half days. They 
stuck me out in the garden on top of an ants' nest and it rained 
the whole time, night and day. Ghastly". He grins toothily, waggles 
his ears and zooms away] ; potion 
; 
[651:it is wrinkled and warm to the touch. I wonder what would 
happen if you threw it?] ; raisin

[652:it is made of crisp new parchment and bound with a red satin 
ribbon. The writing on it is thin and spiky, and its heading reads: 
"A Spell for Chasms"] ; scroll
; 
[653:these are in their natural form. There are tiny brown wrinkled 
seeds; small, coconut-shaped things; long crumbly golden sticks, and 
cubes of a deep red wood. All are pungently aromatic, giving off a 
wild, sweet scent - and all are scored with jagged teethmarks that 
could only have left by a troll] ; spices

; 
[656:it is made of the finest silk, heavy, and as cool as ice. 
Its colour is of deep midnight blue, and runes stitched in silver 
thread glimmer among its folds like stars in the firmament. A 
heavy silver clasp adorns its collar, and this also is shaped as 
two great, interlocking runes] ; cloak

[658:they are of stout blue leather with reinforced seams and a 
small loop on each wristband] ; leather gloves
; 
[659:there is a popping sound and a small female imp in a 
diaphanous green dress appears just above you and hovers six 
inches from the end of your nose. "I see you're looking at 
Granny's ring", she says perkily. "She wanted to give it to me, 
but I wouldn't have it - far too risky! It has a different 
effect on every person who uses it. Granny was fine - it used to 
turn her into a housefly, and she would spend all her spare time 
buzzing in and out of her neighbours' houses so she could be 
first in with the latest scandal. But of course, in the end she became 
so unpopular that people would try to swat her on sight, so she decided 
it would have to go. As none of us would take it off her hands 
she gave it to a travelling pedlar who spent the next five years 
as a tree stump in the middle of a swamp, until a passing will 
o' the wisp took pity on him and removed it from his left 
branch. After that we lost track of it. Cheerio!" and she 
vanishes as suddenly as she arrived] ; ring
; 
[660:it is made of half-inch thick limewood with a central boss 
of beaten bronze held in place with gilded rivets. Its rim is 
bound with leather, and a complicated design involving outlandish 
beasts and yards of ribbon is painted on ly padded and looks extremely warm] ; linen shirt

[664:they are made of nasty blue plastic, with yellow drawstrings at

so that the lid does not quite close properly and rattles when the box

and silver wire and its bone hilt is beautifully carved. The 
pommel is bound with a filigree of gold wire, and its single 
blade is completely blunt] ; dagger

[675:it is one of those old-fashioned ones made of brass and shaped 
like an elongated Z, with a grip at one end and a one-inch square 
section at the other] ; handle 
; 
[676:it is intricate, and very large and heavy, made from iron 
long gone rusty and pock-marked with age. From the size of it, 
it must belong to a massive door] ; key 
; 
[677:its design is archaic, along the lines of those favoured by 
genie-hunters, except that this lamp is earthenware, and no 
amount of polishing will make it shine.

Bletch is a particularly fine specimen of his breed, large, ugly, 
green, and mean. He has four pairs of limbs: three the horny, 
knobbly, high-hinged legs of a spider, and the other a pair of 
pallid, groping human arms which sprout from his chest and 
fidget aimlessly with the empty air. His small eyes are close-set 
and slitted, and glitter dangerously beneath drooping eyelids, 
while his enormous segmented tail trails down the tunnel, its 
pointed tip curving up to meet the roof beneath which you must 
pass. He looks about as trustworthy as Genghis

He stands four-square to the wind, stocky and stalwart as all 
dwarves do, yet his mouth is melancholy. Beneath his finery his 
shoulders droop, his grey-flecked beard hangs as if wilted by 
the slow passage of many dismal years, and the light of his eyes 
is dim. He paces the beautiful room with the slow, dreary 
tread of one following a coffin, and every now and again sighs 
gloomily] ; Bostog the Dwarf

impossibly high. Looking carefully, you find the letters "Xiiz" carved 
into its smooth side at head-height] 
; 
[745:, scarcely more than a ^N heap of ^N rubble, though a deep 
^N alcove survives in the remains of one ^N overgrown ^N wall. This 
house seems an ideal place to cache your loot] 
; 
[746: which could lead to an extensive cave system. Large 
^N footprints crisscross the surrounding area, joining a ^N wide 
^N path which leads down into the ground] 
; 
[747: of ^N ash ^N trees, their keys hanging in ^N limp ^N clusters 
that rattle dully in the breeze] 
; 
[748: in the wall of ^N castle ^N Cakabol. It is surrounded by a 
^N tasteful ^N montage of ^N bones and sports a "Beware of the Rat" 
^N sign] 
; 
[749:, a ^N great ^N archway through the ^N granite ^N walls of 
^N castle ^N Cakabol. The ^N building seems deserted; a ^N near-ruin, 
silent as the grave but for occasional mouse-squeaks] 
; 
[750:. The ^N trees stand in ^N serried, ^N lowering ^N ranks. 
Darkness breeds beneath their ^N silent ^N canopies and their 
^N scented ^N needles lie thick upon the ground. All is very, very 
still, as though waiting - and watching..] 
; 
[751:, and here the ^N trees seem older. There are gaps in the 
^N forest ^N roof where the sun shines through, and the ^N trunks 
are hoary with ^N grey ^N lichens; ^N moss dangles from their 
^N twisted limbs. The ground is covered with ^N dead ^N twigs and 
^N branches which crackle like pistol-fire beneath your feet] 
; 
[752: whose ^N surface glimmers with ^N limpid lights. Small ^N twigs 
and ^N water-hoppers dot its ^N tranquil ^N surface] 
; 
[753: with a ^N rough ^N floor littered with ^N chunks of ^N rock] 
; 
[754: whose ^N smooth ^N floor has been swept clean of dust and 
stones] 
; 
[755: where a ^N mighty ^N fire burns white-hot, its heat fanned by 
rushing air. ^N Weaponry and ^N armour in various stages of completion 
litter the ^N three ^N great ^N tables and hang from the ^N walls] 
; 
[756:, which is a ^N clutter of ^N bizarre ^N equipment, ^N books, 
^N papers and ^N unidentifiable ^N gadgets] 
; 
[757:. The ^N thick, ^N jewel-coloured ^N pile deadens every sound] 
; 
[758: which is flamboyantly decorated: ^N carpets, ^N chairs, ^N drapes 
and ^N hangings combine in a ^N riot of ^N mismatched ^N colours] 
; 
[759: where mysterious breezes waft from ^N hidden ^N shafts] 
; 
[761:. The ^N smooth ^N walls are whorled and veined with shades of green, 
red and white] 
; 
[762:, its ^N marble ^N steps polished and treacherous] 
; 
[763: which is cool and dim and has a ^N deep ^N blue ^N carpet. An 
^N ornate ^N wooden ^N chair faces the ^N stairwell, occupied by a 
^N silent ^N figure] 
; 
[764: belonging to Nezzon the Alchemist. Most of her ^N chemicals and 
^N instruments are securely locked in ^N diamond-glass ^N cabinets, but 
the ^N litter of her present project is scattered haphazardly all 
around. One ^N cabinet bears a neat array of her ^N finished 
^N products, each labelled in careful hand with such legends as: "For 
to Banish the Nits", "To Make Whole the Half-hearted", and "A Sure-fire 
Cure for Caries"] 
; 
[765:. A ^N small ^N hole in the floor looks down onto ^N flowing 
^N lava, far below] 
; 
[766:, winding from north to south. ^N Flickering ^N shadows play 
across its ^N rough ^N walls] 
; 
[767:: a ^N cube of ^N reflective ^N diamond-glass. Uncountable 
^N reflections line up into the distance, mimicking your every 
movement] 
; 
[768:. A ^N faint ^N hissing ^N noise echoes from its walls] 
; 
[769: with an ^N arched ^N doorway to the east and a ^N dismal and a 
^N gloomy ^Nfood strewn everywhere] 
; 
[772:, almost a hundred metres across, the ^N high ^N roof could only 
be supported by magik. A ^N thin ^N layer of ^N pink and ^N blue 
^N mist covers the floor, swirling into ^N eddies as you walk] 
; 
[773: where Saxa undertakes his arcane research. In contrast to the 
splendour of the circular room nearby, this study is small and 
neat - its ^N walls covered by ^N grey ^N books with titles like: 
"Men, Means and Motives - a Study in Manipulation" and "The Pin's 
Heafood strewn everywhere] 
; 
[772:, almost a hundred metres across, the ^N high ^N roof could only

"Men, Means and Motives - a Study in Manipulation" and "The Pin's 
Head - Half a Million Angels and Still Counting"] 
; 
[774: absolutely choked with the ^N accumulation of ^N years. 
^N Bulging ^N filing-cabinets lean crazily against the walls, 
^N papers spilling from their ^N half-open ^N drawers. ^N Rough 
^N notes and ^N jottings are strewn over the ^N desk and ^N chairs, 
and the floor is covered with ^N piles of old ^N essays and 
^N manuscripts bound together with ^N tattered ^N red ^N ribbons] 
; 
[775: with no distinguishing features whatsoever] 
; 
[776:, lord of light and darkness. An ^N inscription set in the west 
wall reads "And Muurdox shall be with you always, for he sends 
messages from the sky". The room is lit by ^N strange ^N globes 
fastened high upon the walls, giving off a brilliant, ruddy light] 
; 
[777:, built by evil yellow elves in times past; its power protected 
by cunning warding spells. It has one ^N huge ^N window, which is set 
into the ^N curving ^N wall at such an angle that the light of the 
setting sun would be cast upon the ^N altar] 
; 
[778:, abode of the evil wizard, Aiken Bonze. Freezing air blasts 
down from above, sending tremors through the ^N columns of ^N ice that 
link ceiling and floor. Each one vibrates with a different note, 
and their foul voices rise together in excruciating harmony] 
; 
[779: but a warm floor. ^N Steam rises through ^N cracks in the 
floor and condenses when it meets the freezing air above. 
The result is most unpleasant] 
; 
[780:, whose purpose remains a total mystery to one and all] 
; 
[781: within a ^N crystal ^N cavern. Heat reflects from every 
^N gleaming ^N wall. ^N Four ^N fragile ^N walkways arc through the 
shimmering air to meet at a ^N tiny ^N platform, supported high in 
the dead centre of the ^N cave. ^N Gouts of ^N glowing ^N magma jet 
upwards, splashing onto the ^N rocks all around before falling back 
into the ^N liquid ^N fire below. The ^N noise and ^N vibration are 
terrifying, but the ^N central platform where you stand is clearly 
protected by powerful magik and is probably ^N safe] 
; 
[782: which all look exactly the same] 
; 
[783:. ^N Multicoloured ^N squares cover the floor, flickering 
hypnotically round your feet as distorted sound booms out] 
; 
[784:. It must be the ^N central ^N vault of ^N Cakabol] 
; 
[785: with no way out] 
; 
[786:. A ^N narrow ^N aisle leads down the centre of the room, between 
the ^N shallow ^N stone ^N troughs that rise one above the other to the 
ceiling] 
; 
[787:, quite dazzled by the icy sheen of its cold, precious walls] 
; 
[788:, its ^N beaten ^N panels of precious metal filled with 
coruscating light] 
; 
[789:, filled with ^N tiny ^N floating ^N particles. Breathing is 
difficult] 
; 
[790: where ^N nonmort ^N worshippers gather for their evil rites. 
Open ^N coffins are stacked against the walls and a foul miasma of 
rottenness rises from their mouths] 
; 
[791: which march in ^N two ^N long, ^N silent ^N ranks down the room. 
They are ^N statues of ^N tall, ^N graceful ^N men and ^N women, their 
faces beautiful, care-worn and sad] 
; 
[792:, stripped of most of its weapons. ^N Suits of ^N ancient 
^N armour mounted on ^N iron ^N crosses stand around the room, 
their ^N links and ^N metalwork rusty and crumbling, their ^N helmets, 
perched above them, dinted and useless. Only a few ^N broken ^N swords 
and ^N bent ^N spears remain in the ^N weapon ^N racks] 
; 
[793:, a mean, cramped place that smells of damp and misery] 
; 
[794:] 
; 
[795: composed entirely of ^N jade, ^N sapphire and ^N aquamarine, 
whose shimmering blues and greens fill the room with the rippling 
luminescence of an ^N undersea ^N grotto] 
; 
[796: of classic proportions, decorated in the best of good taste 
with muted, unobtrusive colours and ^N elegant, ^N carved-oak 
^N furniture. It is embellished with ^N several ^N fine ^N paintings 
and ^N tapestries, and a ^N superb ^N collection of ^N hand-thrown, 
^N painted ^N pottery] 
; 
[797:. This ^N strange ^N collection of room-sculptures wvil ^N mist 
shrouds the ^N landscape to the north, lapping about the ^N imposing 
^N walls of ^N castle ^N Cakabol] 
; 
[802: which lights up the water in this cave, clearly showing a 
^N hole in the ^N north ^N wall. ^N Eyeless ^N fish cluster round, as 
if they can feed on the ^N radiance] 
; 
[803: with the ^N surface ^N shimmering above you] 
; 
[804:, its ^N cold, ^N dark ^N waters gurgling dully around your body] 
; 
[805:, and the ^N water holds you with ^N fingers of ^N ice] 
; 
[806:vil ^N mist 
shrouds the ^N landscape to the north, lapping about the ^N imposing 
^N walls of ^N castle ^N Cakabol]

; 
[805:, and the ^N water holds you with ^N fingers of ^N ice] 
; 
[806:, its ^N muddy ^N floor oozing around your ankles. A dim light 
shines down through the water from above] 
; 
[807:. ^N Pallid ^N fish with ^N huge, ^N blind ^N eyes slither past, 
sparks of ^N phosphorescence on their ^N teeth and ^N tails] 
; 
[808:. Strange lights glimmer in its ^N murky ^N depths; ^N reds and 
^N yellows and ^N greens wavering in the ^N cold ^N currents, like the 
lights of a far-off city seen from a great height] 
; 
[809: where an ^N icy ^N current flows strongly from some unseen 
entrance, mingling with the ^N rushing ^N waters] 
; 
[810:, its walls carved into ^N strange and ^N fantastic ^N shapes by 
the ^N eddies of a hundred centuries] 
; 
[811: where the ^N waters play; burbling over ^N rocks and 
stones and echoing down long ^N tunnels to invisible and fathomless 
cavern-depths. Here of old, in the unseen waters of the world, 
did Leviathan spawn, and the mighty Kraken crawl, before ever 
they emerged to cast their awesome shadows upon the bright waters 
under the sun, and the memory of their passing lingers still] 
; 
[812: and the dark waters pound above your head, while ^N little 
^N pebbles and ^N sharp ^N stones scour your skin] 
; 
[813: where cerulean light slants, shimmering, through the ^N silent 
^N waters; reflecting from the ^N serene, ^N blue-crystal ^N walls] 
; 
[814: where the ^N still, ^N dark ^N waters lie tranquil, barely 
troubled by the currents which flow busily beneath the surface, each 
hurrying from some unknown, unseen source to its unimaginable 
destination] 
; 
[815:. A soft voice seems to whisper inside your head: 
% 
%"Here is the place where the dead crabs go, 
%And mermaids play midst silent shells. 
%Here five-armed starfish feed and grow, 
%And here the Sea-Girl dwells. 
% 
%One stormy night she sank to rest 
%Upon this God-forsaken strand. 
%Yet who can say they be not blest 
%Who sleep thus far from land? 
% 
%Her shining spars now draped with weeds, 
%Her empty cabins dream. 
%And in her berths the pale squid feeds, 
%And old bones whitely gleam"] 
; 
[816:, lit with a deep green light] 
; 
[817: which stretches away into darkness, its ^N steps slick with 
^N damp and ^N slime. The air smells heavily of decay, catching at the 
back of your throat] 
; 
[818:, its ^N rough ^N stone ^N surrounds flaky with age and covered 
with ^N dank ^N green ^N moss. A ^N lid of ^N rotting ^N timber rests 
against it and a ^N broken ^N bucket lies discarded in one ^N corner] 
; 
[819:. An ^N old ^N table is pushed crazily against one wall, its 
^N surface covered with dust and ^N cobwebs] 
; 
[820:, The ^N ground drops away to one side in a ^N damp ^N tumble of 
^N rocks, and phantom sounds emerge from the darkness] 
; 
[821: from which issues a foul smell of decay] 
; 
[822:, the ^N scummy water slopping unpleasantly against the ^N dank 
^N walls] 
; 
[823: with ^N greasy ^N rivulets running down from the ^N roof] 
; 
[824: of stagnant water. All ^N kinds of ^N debris floats on its 
^N surface, rank and unwholesome] 
; 
[825:: acrid water percolates down from the ^N roof, leaving ^N trails 
of ^N evil-coloured ^N residuum] 
; 
[826:. A ^N monument to ^N Gothic ^N kitsch, it has ^N stone 
^N balustrades ^N carved into ^N rampant ^N curlicues and ^N scrolls, 
^N gargoyles wherever gargoyles could conceivably be fitted in, 
and ^N lattice-work wherever they couldn't] 
; 
[827:, edging around a ^N narrow ^N ledge which skirts the ^N depths 
below. A ^N mighty ^N jet of water shoots up from the ^N abyss, in a 
^N roaring ^N column that drenches the ledge with ^N icy ^N spray] 
; 
[828: where ^N oil weeps from the rocks and ^N dribbles in ^N pinguid 
^N rivulets] 
; 
[829:. Abandoned years ago, the ^N grain ^N store is full of 
^N shrivelled ^N seed and ^N gnawed ^N sacking] 
; 
[830: where ^N grimy ^N sleeping ^N furs lie scattered haphazardly 
on the ^N floor, along with ^N piles of ^N smelly ^N underwear and 
^N dirty ^N socks. ^N Mice scuttle tamely over all, gnawing at the 
^se ^N darkness hides a ^N veritable 
^N minefield of ^N sharp ^N bricks and ^N crumbling ^N stonework] 
; 
[836: of ^N dead ^N wood - the traditional material for cabinets. 
^N Dry, ^N brown ^N olive ^N leaves, (or "^N olivetti"), are mingled 
with other ^N assorted ^N woodland ^N refuse on the ^N floor] 
; 
[837: whose ^N floor crackles with a ^N blue ^N fire of 
^N electricity, leaving a hot, tickly smell in the air] 
; 
[838: where the breeze soughs among the ^N high ^N stone ^N beams, 
fluttese ^N darkness hides a ^N veritable 
^N minefield of ^N sharp ^N bricks and ^N crumbling ^N stonework] 
; 
[836: of ^N dead ^N wood - the traditional material for cabinets. 
^N Dry, ^N brown ^N olive ^N leaves, (or "^N olivetti"), are mingled

^N electricity, leaving a hot, tickly smell in the air] 
; 
[838: where the breeze soughs among the ^N high ^N stone ^N beams, 
fluttering the ^N tarpaulin-covered ^N boxes and scattering ^N clouds 
of dust and ^N chaff, which tumble across the floor like miniature 
^N sandstorms] 
; 
[839: which is almost, but not quite, completely empty] 
; 
[840:, decorated entirely in shades of red] 
; 
[841: whose ^N curved ^N sides glisten black, like the scales of a 
brittle insect. ^N Tissue-thin ^N fragments of ^N strange ^N rock 
scrunch satisfyingly under your feet] 
; 
;; [842, 843, 844:] 
; 
[845:, filled with a damp heat, where ^N misty ^N tendrils spiral up 
from the floor] 
; 
[846:, its sides streaked with ^N sulphurous ^N deposits and 
^N tumescent ^N crystals. It reeks with the bad-egg smell of volcanic 
gases, and ^N acrid ^N fumes sear your nose and lungs] 
; 
[847: where a ^N section of the ^N roof has collapsed inwards, 
leaving a ^N pile of ^N sharp boulders and ^N rocks that almost block 
your passage. Water drips sullenly onto the ^N tumbled ^N stones] 
; 
[848:. The partial collapse of the cave beyond has spilled 
^N rubble into the storage area and carried a large part of the 
^N entrance ^N arch with it. ^N Large ^N cracks transect the ceiling 
and from them issue the strange squeaks and groanings of tortured 
rock. Every now and again ^N little ^N shower of dust and ^N pebbles 
trickles onto the floor] 
; 
[849:. Its ^N roof is quite low and divided into a series of ^N small, 
^N pointed ^N domes] 
; 
[850:: its ^N floor, and every ^N bare ^N surface, covered with a 
^N layer of ^N intermingled ^N chaff and dust, presumably blown by 
the wind that issues from the cave beyond] 
; 
[851:, its ^N shelves broken and empty, its ^N floor bare of all save a 
^N thick ^N covering of dust and ^N chaff, which has fallen through 
from the room above. ^N Cobwebs depend from the ^N ceiling, tattered 
and abandoned, waving lazily in the draft] 
; 
[852:. Everything here is black; a dusty black with a faintly 
tacky surface that deadens sound and gives slightly to the touch] 
; 
[853:. Light shafts in through the ^N uneven ^N opening far above, 
highlighting every black smudge and stain on your clothes and skin 
and imparting a magical aura to the ^N jagged ^N stones] 
; 
[854: about five feet high and three across. It is clean and 
smells pleasantly of mothballs and lavender and beeswax polish] 
; 
[855: festooned with the efforts of an ^N army of ^N spiders. Their 
webs are thick and tangled, and cling to everything they touch with 
^N flaccid, ^N clammy ^N tendrils. They appear for the most part to be 
abandoned] 
; 
[856: its ^N steps high and narrow, worn down by the passage of 
centuries of labouring feet. It is scrupulously clean, and every 
^N step has been painstakingly red-leaded and polished] 
; 
[857: with ^N sharp, ^N protruding ^N rocks hanging from the ceiling 
and impeding movement. Other stones stick up from the floor, 
scraping your knees and hands] 
; 
[858: occupied by an ^N enormous ^N four-poster bed with ^N crimson 
^N curtains. ^N Elegant ^N tapestries cover the walls and a ^N thick 
^N rug lies on the ^N polished ^N floor. A ^N fire smoulders in the 
^N walk-in ^N fireplace, casting ^N red ^N lights on the fine ^N cloth 
which covers the ^N table, and on the ^N carved ^N wooden ^N chairs. 
The room smells of ^N potpourri, ^N lavender and hot spiced wine] 
; 
[859: where ^N gentle ^N breezes blow, calling forth phantom voices from 
the hidden depths. ^N Stalactites of ^N delicate ^N rose and blue
^N crystal hang down to meet the ^N stubby ^N stalagmites. Between 
them fall ^N translucent ^N curtains of ^N living ^N crystal, like 
silent ^N waterfalls and ^N crests of waves, caught forever out of 
Time] 
; 
[860:. The ^N mouths of ^N tunnels dot the walls like the holes in 
^N cheese, but only a few of them are wide enough for you to enter] 
; 
[861:, its ^N cold ^N steps covered with a ^N narrow ^N blue-patterned 
^N carpet grown threadbare and faded] 
; 
[862: with ^N cold ^N metal banisters and a dark and forbidding 
atmosphere] 
; 
;; [863 
lords at the great feasts would be obliged to eat their meals] 
; 
[877:, a vast room, some 120 metres long, ^N panelled and ^N beamed 
with ^N golden ^N oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the 
^N central ^N firepit.

%At the western end of the Hall is raised the ^N great ^N dais 
where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit 
on feast days, backed by a ^N rich, ^N decaying ^N tapestry depicting

where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit 
on feast days, backed by a ^N rich, ^N decaying ^N tapestry depicting 
the chivalric stages of a boar hunt. Twenty feet above the floor of 
the Hall, and encircling it, runs the minstrels' gallery, its 
wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into disrepair; and 
from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole, hangs 
an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and 
peeling. It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. 
A few trestle tables are stacked along one side of the 
Hall, but any chairs have long since been removed, and all seems 
to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants down from 
the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof] 
; 
[878: where little remains of its former glory save ^N dust and 
sunbeams and a ^N solitary, ^N buzzing ^N fly] 
; 
[879:, a ^N small, ^N windowless ^N cell whose ^N clammy ^N stone 
^N walls reflect a cold hostility] 
; 
[880:, a ^N once-elegant ^N vault with ^N high, ^N fluted ^N arches 
and ^N carved ^N pilasters now fallen into disrepair. Dust and 
^N cobwebs hang heavy on the ^N racks of ^N mouldering ^N bottles and 
the air is redolent of ^N dampness and ^N decay] 
; 
[881:. The ^N wooden ^N panels and ^N once-shiny ^N floor seem to 
exude an ^N all-pervading ^N odor of ^N decay] 
; 
[882:. Its former glory has long passed by. The ^N great ^N stone 
^N columns still soar up into the ^N vaulted ^N roof, yet they are 
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, 
broken-backed and dusty, across the floor. Dust hangs suspended 
in the air, dancing in the ^N sunbeams which pierce the ^N dingy 
^N shadows of the place] 
; 
[883:, once the ^N servants' ^N hall, where they would take their 
meals when the work was done, having saved the best food, as always, 
for themselves. But it is deserted now, and silence lies 
heavy upon it] 
; 
[884:. A ^N sickly-sweet ^N smell permeates through from the 
corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, 
save for a thick layer of ^N grime over everything. The ^N pots and 
^N pans hang on their ^N hooks, well-ordered and only slightly 
tarnished. ^N Unburnt ^N logs lie in the ^N great ^N hearth, only 
needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life again, 
and beside them the ^N mighty ^N spit stands idle. The platters are  
stacked neatly in their ^N racks and the ^N huge ^N scrubbed-pine 
^N table is bare and empty. It is as if everyone, having finished 
their work, was suddenly spirited away, never to return - and several 
^N purple-red ^N stains on the floor suggest that the spiriting was 
not done gently] 
; 
[885:: Really an ^N enormous ^N pantry, it is obviously still in use 
if only by a few, for ^N strings of ^N onions hang from the ceiling 
and several ^N jars of ^N preserves and ^N pickles stand on the 
^N rickety ^N shelves] 
; 
[886:, obviously better suited for ^N dachshunds than ^N people] 
; 
[887:, once lined by ^N weapon ^N racks which are now empty: their 
contents looted or rusted away] 
; 
[888: between three passages. ^N Condensation drips from the ^N roof] 
; 
[889:, a ^N quiet, ^N sunlit ^N room, filled with the peaceful 
atmosphere that comes to such places after long and tranquil years; 
a feeling of knowledge, as though the room itself had drunk of the 
wisdom of those who used it] 
; 
[890:, where the presence of ^N large, ^N striped ^N linen ^N bags 
and ^N reels of ^N cotton suggest that ^N mattresses were made]

[915:, carved out of solid ^N volcanic ^N sulphur. ^N Steam escaping 
from the room next door swirls around its upper reaches, mingling with

[926:, mined from a ^N thick ^N black ^N seam of ^N irreplaceable 
^N carboniferous ^N deposits]

before dawn and just after sunset, when everything seems clearly 
visible, but is really hidden in the darkness]

[932:, the outcast God who wanted no worshippers because he 
thought it would be more fun to retire and spend his 
days fishing for fallen stars on the Milky Way, and so made life 
so miserable for those stubborn enough to ignore his wishes that 
they went off in a dudgeon to worship Zog of Snortlenose instead, 
taking all temple fittings with them.

[933:... Which is only marginally different from a ^N sloping room]

[934: which plunge into murky darkness] 
; 
[935:, possibly Zog of Snortlenose, but nobody is really sure any 
more, because all his followers got so fed up with the way he kept 
answering their prayers by doing exactly what they said and not 
what they meant, that they became Socialists instead. Zog himself 
went back to his former profession of dreaming up new forms of 
pollution to sell to Mankind for a huge profit, and is doing very 
nicely, thank you]
