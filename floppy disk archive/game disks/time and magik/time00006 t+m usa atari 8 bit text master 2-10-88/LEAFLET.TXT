The Austin brothers have been creating top-selling adventures 
since 1982. From their base in the Mendips, the three brothers 
create their fantasy worlds, replete with devious puzzles to 
tax their ardent followers. 

Titles such as Knight Orc and Gnome Ranger have been developed 
using KAOS, the sophisticated adventure system which, they 
claim, is the best in the world. Its powerful features include 
ram save, oops (to retrace your steps), multi-tasking and 
compression of every type of data (text, puzzles, vocabulary, 
pictures etc).
