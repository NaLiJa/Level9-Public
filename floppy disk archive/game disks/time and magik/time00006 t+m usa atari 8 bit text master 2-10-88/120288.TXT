Dear Peter,

           Thanks for your fax yesterday. Looks OK to me, but I'll 
have to discuss the potential US deal with Mike this weekend to 
make sure he agrees. 

Notes:

1) Just to clarify, the "all formats" in 4 and 5 presumably 
refers to the UK versions of the product. (Otherwise we could 
have to wait a long time... presumably until Sharedata released 
part 3 in the States). 

2) Would Sharedata like the 8-bit Atari version on the back of 
their Apple II disk? 

3) The change I mentioned was to strike out the last sentence 
of section 6, which is in parallel with part of section 8, and 
might imply that the contract could be cancelled by either party 
regardless (e.g we could take the advances and run). On re-
reading it, I'm less bothered - it seems likely to me that 
section 8 would be taken as an elaboration of section 6, and 
therefore the questionable sentence is irrelevant anyway. (We 
didn't quite clear this matter up, at the end of the signing 
meeting). I leave the matter to your judgement. 

4) Can we do the signing in two stages, without a physical meeting, 
please? Everyone's a bit busy just now! 

                              Yours faithfully,
