European homelands cannot be attacked or captured. If any of the four 
bases which start under the control of England and France are captured, 
they are assumed to be burnt and are removed from the map. 


                            EQUATIONS 

Average statistics for an empire are calculated on a modified root 
mean square (RMS) basis, weighted by population. Average value = 
square root of ((value squared * state population) for all states 
/ total population). This reflects the fact that rich areas have more 
of an influence in an empire than poor states. "Protected States" are 
treated as if they had half their real populations. 

Potential tax = total population * average infrastructure. But 
unfortunately you lose 10% for every point of law below 10, to 
bandits and general corruption. So: tax = pop * infra * law / 10. 

Cost of a change in infrastructure, fighting spirit or law and order
= change squared * population. So change by 1 each turn, rather than 
saving up for a bigger change later. Such status numbers are rounded 
down for calculation purposes before use, so is e.g an infrastructure 
of 3.5 has no more effect than one of 3. 

Fighting spirit bonusses. When using "fighting spirit" to work out 
battle odds, and only then, add 1 if you control any Gurkhas, and 
the same for Sikhs, and for either of the Europeans, but add -1 if 
your empire includes both Hindus and Moslems. (Note that the bonuses 
are already included in the initial values for fighting spirit, and 
that you cannot ally with an enemy, or with mutual enemies). 

Each troop costs 1 per turn to maintain, but troops cost twice that 
much in the turn they are recruited. There is no rebate if some of 
them are disbanded. 

Combat. After each ruler has seen to his economy, he may decide to 
attack neighbouring countries. When the aggressor specifies the first 
such country, the defending ruler assigns some troops to its defence 
(even though it's not his turn; and he gets the opportunity to lease 
third party troops), and the aggressor must attack with at least 1 
troop. If the aggressor loses, his turn ends; if he wins he can use 
other, unassigned troops to attack elsewhere.  

When the aggressor assigns troops to the battle, he alters their 
numbers by clicking on + and - icons (the usual way of entering 
numbers in ther game). The screen shows both the numbers on both 
sides AND a continuously updated display of the resulting odds. 
The correct numbers of men symbols are shown on each side, maybe 
holding flags whose relative sizes indicate the odds. 

At the start of a battle, local volunteers increase the number of 
defending troops by 5 (unless it's a revolt, when nobody volunteers 
to fight their own people). Even if there are no paid-for defenders. 
These five are like any other troops, but are the first to suffer 
casualties and are left behind - melting back into the community - 
if the other defenders retreat, or if the country is taken. 

In the battle, multiply both sides' troops by the corresponding 
fighting spirit values, and compare numbers to arrive at the odds. 
Round down the odds and look up casualties: 
   5:1 winner no casualties, loser 100%, 
   4:1 winner 10% casualties, loser 50%, 
   3:1 winner 10% casualties, loser 40%, 
   2:1 winner 10% casualties, loser 30%, 
   1:1 both sides suffer 20% casualties. 
Casualties are rounded up to the nearest 1. After each round of 
battle, the opposing generals can decide whether their surviving 
troops should retreat. 

Individual troops can only be used once per turn. So e.g retreating 
survivors can't be used to defend another state, and successful 
invaders can not go on to immediately attack an adjacent state. But 
there is one exception: victorious troops remain at the site of the 
battle and can be used to fight against subsequent attackers - in 
other words they will defend themselves if asked. 
 
Status. Holding a "Durbah", or tournament, costs at least 11 gold. 
It includes a grand procession of elephants. Status gain = number 
of elephants = cost-10. At each Durbah, all the players take part 
in three rounds of peg sticking. Players compete against each other 
in pairs and the odd one out gets a computer controlled opponent. 
The winner of each round gains 1 status. 

Combat additions to status = 3*defensive wins, -2*offensive attacks, 
-3*losses, -4*alliances refused, -20*traitorous attacks on allies. 
Status for size = population/10. 

Specific effects on status when an individual country needs to make 
a decision.. +10 if help needed against a country who the candidate 
has as their enemy, halved for help from a country with the wrong 
religion (Hindu vs Moslem, or Catholic vs Protestant). 

When somebody is attacked and expects to lose (i.e if the attacker 
could use half his available troops against all the defender's 
available troops and get 2:1 or better), they can approach one 
neighbour for help, as a "white knight". Only neighbours with enough 
offensive troops, to potentially redress the odds, are candidates. 
When deciding which country to approach, the odds of each is 
proportional to its status, modified as above. 

Chance of accepting the approach = (offensive troops/population)-25%. 
Troops will be offered at twice the usual price (i.e 4), plus 1 if 
the religions differ (Hindu vs Moslem, or Catholic vs Protestant). 
Then troops can be freely bought until their number drops to 25% 
of the population, and the buyer does so until his chances in the 
following battle rise above the "ask for help" threshold. 

If the buyer has run out of money and would still like more troops, 
there is a 50% chance that he will ask the seller for "Protected 
State" status. The seller always agrees, and takes over the defence.
