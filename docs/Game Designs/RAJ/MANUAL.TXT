                       Champion of the Raj 

The Mogul emperors ruled India for two centuries. They brought law 
to the people and graced its cities with marvellous buildings like 
the Red Fort of Agra and the Taj Mahal. 

But by 1800 their empire is collapsing, riven by feuds and rebellions, 
and India has reverted to a host of warring states.  

The Thugs have taken bloody advantage of this chaos. They are evil 
fanatics who murder thousands of people as sacrifices to the goddess 
Kali. By ruthless terrorism, they are rapidly winning power over the 
whole of India. 

No single state can fight the Thugs, who are quickly increasing in 
numbers and power. So it is vital that a strong leader emerges to 
unite India against them, before they can plunge the land into a 
bloodbath. 

You are one of six rival leaders, each fighting to unite India: 
* Viceroy of the British East India Company, 
* Consul of the French East India Company, 
* Emperor of the remnant of the Mogul Empire, 
* Maharajah of the Maruthras, 
* Maharajah Singh of the warlike Sikhs, 
* Chief of the Gurkhas. 
(If more that one person is playing, you each pick a leader). 

The rivals each have their own advantages and disadvantages. You 
should probably try winning as the Viceroy first, and leave the 
Gurkhas until last; they have great problems expanding their 
fledgling state in the mountains to conquer the Indian plains. 

Whoever wins must both defeat his rivals and smash the Thugs. It will 
not be easy! 


Computer Requirements: 
* IBM PC, Tandy 1000, Amstrad PC or any other 100% compatible. 
* MS-DOS version 2.1 or later (type MS-DOS command "VER"). 
* 360K (5 1/4") or 720K (3 1/2") floppy disk drive(s). 
* 512K of RAM, or more. 
* VGA, EGA, CGA colour, CGA black-and-white, MCGA, or Tandy TGA 
  graphics, with a suitable monitor. 

Optional Equipment: 
* Hard disk drive. The game is at its best, installed on hard disk. 
* Second floppy disk drive, of the same size, is strongly recommended 
  if you intend to run the game from floppy disk, rather than hard 
  disk. This means two disks can be read by the computer at a time, 
  and disk swapping will be minimized. 
* An average or fast PC. A computer even less powerful than a PC XT 
  (8086 and 8mhz clock speed) is not recommended. You can slow down 
  the game on a fast PC, but not speed it up on a slow one. 
* Joystick plugged into the game port (as Joystick "A" if you have 
  a twin adaptor). 
* Mouse (you also need to have installed your mouse driver software 
  before running the game). 
* 640K of RAM. The game will happily use up to 640K of memory if this 
  is available - using the extra as cache. (If your PC has extended 
  memory, it is normally also a good idea to use a disk cache utility, 
  such as Microsoft's SmartDrive, to further reduce disk reads.) 
* Roland, AdLib, or Sound Blaster music card. If you play a lot of 
  games but have not yet got one of these boards, we recommend 
  that you try one. We were amazed at the difference they make. 


Before Playing: 
* Please use the MS-DOS "TYPE" command to read the file README.TXT on 
  one of the game disks (probably the first). This contains the most 
  up to date information on your particular version. 
* Anti-virus note: Never, ever unprotect your original "Champion of 
  the Raj" disks. If your computer asks you to do this, it could be 
  because a virus is trying to copy itself onto them. 


Starting "Champion of the Raj" for the first time: 
* Boot your PC with DOS version 2.1 or later (i.e any operating 
  system version produced in recent years), and then place the first 
  game disk in drive A: (or drive B:) 
* Type... 
  A:               (or B:) 
  RAJ 
* Use keypad keys 2 ( ) and 8( ) to choose a display type from the 
  list. Then press Enter ( ). (If there are several display types 
  which all seem suitable, e.g there is more than one reference to 
  VGA, choose the first one by preference. If this then gives 
  problems during play, it may mean your PC is not 100% compatible, 
  so try again with a later equivalent from the list.) 
* In the same way, choose: 
  "Joystick On", or "Joystick Off"; 
  "Mouse On", or "Mouse Off" (to use a mouse, you must have installed 
  appropriate mouse driver software before running the game); 
  "Roland", "AdLib", "Sound Blaster", or "Music Off"; 
  "Sound Effects On" or "Sound Effects Off". (Sound effects can slow 
  the game noticeably on a slow PC).
  "Play Game", or "Install on Hard Disk". (If you choose hard disk, 
  the game next asks you for the disk name: enter e.g C: ). 
* An animated introduction sequence follows, taking about five minutes. 
  To skip it, press any key. At the end of this introduction, the game 
  pauses and asks you to press a key; do so, or else the game will 
  repeat the introduction over again. 


Starting "Champion of the Raj" on hard disk: 
* The first time, follow the instructions above. 
* Next time, type 
  C:         (or the drive you installed it on)
  CD \MIRRORSOFT
  RAJ 
  and the game will run without needing to ask you for all its
  configuration information. 

                           Playing the Game 


Control Methods: 
This manual describes how to play "Champion of the Raj" entirely 
with a joystick, but there are three alternatives... 
* Joystick: push it in the appropriate direction and press "fire" 
  to act.  
* Mouse: on menus and maps, use it as you normally would; elsewhere, 
  move the mouse slightly in the same direction as described for the 
  joystick and press the left button for "fire". 
* Numeric keypad: this is used like a joystick; press keys to move 
  (8=up, 9=up right, 6=right, 3=down right, 2=down, 1=down left, 
  4=left, 7=up left). To "fire" press 5, Enter or the space bar. 

You normally use the joystick/mouse/keypad to move a hand around the 
screen. Most of the game is controlled by icons (little pictures for 
e.g Yes, No, Talk, Fight etc) and you move the hand so that its 
finger-tip is on the icon you want, and press fire to select it. 
(This is also called "clicking on" the icon).  

Only icons which make sense are shown; e.g you will not get the chance 
to attack if you have no troops available. 

Champion of the Raj also includes six arcade games, with different 
types of Indian action. Instructions for these are displayed on the 
screen the first time you encounter them. 

The following special functions, controlled from the keyboard, work 
on most (but not necessarily all) screens: 
* The + and - keys adjust game speed. 
* The M key switches the music on or off (though you don't get music 
  if you selected "Music Off" when starting the game). 
* The P key pauses the game; press R (resume) or C to continue. 
* The S key toggles sound effects on or off (providing you chose 
  "Sound Effects On" when starting). 
* Control C cancels the game and quits to the operating system. 


                         CHOICE SCREEN 

The game starts at a banquet, where the six rivals to govern India 
have met before going their separate ways. 

Select + and - to adjust the number of players (1-6 people can play). 

Next point at a sitting ruler and press fire to make him stand, or 
do the same to a standing ruler to make him sit. The standing rulers 
are the ones you have chosen to play. There can never be more 
rulers standing than the number of players chosen, so any excess sit 
automatically. 

When you are happy with the ruler (or rulers) standing, select "play" 
to start the game. A window opens for each ruler, so you can enter the 
name of the person playing him (click above or below each letter to 
adjust it, then click on OK to continue). And then the game starts...  


                         HEADQUARTERS SCREEN 

You have a headquarters appropriate for your rank and nationality, 
and run your empire from here. 

It includes a map of India, a book (or scroll) on the table in 
front of it, icons on the wall, and a bell to end your turn.  


MAP 

The map shows about twenty Indian states and four port cities (which 
are controlled separately from the surrounding states). 

Independent states have no flags or plain blue flags, while others 
have the national flags of their current emperor. Capital states have 
crowns on top of their flagpoles. 

When you click on any Indian state on the map, its flag flutters, 
its details appear on the book, and appropriate icons appear on the 
wall. (For example, if the state is next to one of yours, so that 
your armies can reach it, the attack icon will usually appear). 
Clicking on the champion, sitting on one side of the headquarters, is 
the same as clicking on your own capital state.  

Click on the bar above the map to roll it up or down (revealing more 
icons on the wall behind). 


BOOK (or Scroll) 

The book shows details (icons and numbers) of the current Indian 
state (the one whose flag is flapping)... 

                             State-Name 
  Attacking-Weaponry   Army-size           Industry   Law-and-Order 
  Defensive-Weaponry   Minimum-Defenders   Gold       Treasury 

Click on any of these nine pieces of information to find out more. 
For example, click on... 
* State Name for details of religion and current status, 
* Attacking-Weaponry icon for what percentage number the icon means, 
* Gold Icon for precisely how much tax the emperor will get next turn. 

If the state is part of an empire, the Army-size, Income and Treasury 
information are for the empire as a whole. 

If the state is your own capital, clicking on the book lets you invest 
for the future. For example, click on... 
* Army Size for the chance to hire more troops, or 
* Industry for the chance to invest in industry (your tax income is 
  proportional to the population, industry and law of your empire, 
  so investment is worth considering). 


ICONS ON THE WALL 

These are your current commands, and are only displayed when 
appropriate. Click on... 
* Attack, to fight the current state (the one whose flag is flapping); 
* Talk, to negotiate instead (this is more likely to be successful if 
  your status is high and, even if the state's ruler agrees to a 
  meeting, you will still have to prove your prowess in an arcade game); 
* Parade (or Durbah) to hold a festival and so raise your status; 
* Decision, to return to a decision postponed earlier; 
* Quit (behind the map) to exit; 
* Save (behind the map) to save your position on disk;  
* Load (behind the map) to load a saved position from disk;  


BELL 

Click on the bell to end your turn. If you postponed a decision 
earlier (e.g whether to help earthquake victims), but did not use the 
decision icon to go back to it, this is the same as answering "no". 



                         RUNNING YOUR EMPIRE 

ECONOMY 

Your tax income depends on the population you rule, and the level of 
your empire's industry and law. 

You pay 1 gold for each of your troops each turn, but troops who you 
used to capture another state last turn are "living off the land" and 
cost nothing. If you have a big army, it's cheaper to use it! 

New troops cost twice this much to hire. 
 
You may decide to use the Book to invest money in your economy 
(industry and law) to increase your future taxes, or in weaponry, so 
your troops fight better). Costs depend on the population of your 
empire, so it sometimes pays to keep small. 

When adding a state to your empire, it is better to capture states 
with good economies, as they will benefit the average figures of 
your empire. Unfortunately, the best places tend to be other people's 
capitals. 


STATUS 

Alternatively, you can invest in a high status and select the Durbah 
(or Parade) icon to invite your fellow rulers to a festival. The more 
elephants you hire (click on the up icons) the better. The idea is to 
impress people, so that they are more likely to join your empire 
peacefully in the future. 

Select talk to negotiate with another prince. If your status is good 
enough, and if there are no religious obstacles, the prince will 
probably invite you to a sporting occasion. And if you prove your 
prowess at his chosen sport (Elephant Racing, or Tiger Hunting), he 
will ally his state into your empire. 

ATTACKING 

Click on a state next to one of yours, and the Attack icon will 
usually appear. You can attack provided you have not already been 
defeated this turn, and still have some troops available (victorious 
troops from previous battles stay where they are, living off the land, 
and can't be used again until next turn). 

Select the attack icon, then click on the up and down icons to adjust 
your troops, and finally on OK. As a general rule, attacking troops 
need at least 2:1 odds to do well.  

If the defender is also a player, let them adjust their defending 
troops in the same way. (You also get to do this, if you are the 
defender and e.g the computer is attacking you). 

If the battle is likely to be a walk-over, the computer handles 
everything without bothering you. But when the odds are close, it is 
probably worth taking personal command of your armies in battle. 
(This game is described later). 

When you capture the capital of an empire, you must capture the 
ruler's palace in order to gain full control. (See later for the game). 
Succeed, and all the vassal states of the empire are captured with 
its capital. Fail, and you only get the capital. 

ARCADE GAMES 

Your decisions and the "random" events in the game often lead to 
arcade game sequences. 

The guru appears whenever a game loads, initially to give you 
instructions and subsequently with wise advice. 


                            TIGER HUNT. 

Even today, tigers kill dozens of Indian people each year. (As I 
write, I bear scratches from a playful, tame, 7 pound cat, so it is 
not surprising that angry, wild, 700 pound cats are somewhat deadly.) 
At the time of the Raj, much of India was plagued by rogue tigers. 

These man-eaters must be shot, to save hundreds of lives, and what 
greater proof of your skill and courage can there be than to kill an 
animal which is willing and able to kill you and others? 

Steer the cross-hairs to aim and press fire to shoot. The recoil kicks 
the gun sideways, but you have a second barrel still to fire. Miss 
twice and you are in trouble, because reloading takes several seconds. 


                           ELEPHANT RACING. 

Climb atop your elephant and you're ready for the off. 

This is a vertically scrolling game, where two elephants race south 
along a wide earth track between grandstands of spectators. And the 
first elephant to get a nose past the winning posts wins. 

Push the joystick left and right to steer, up to slow and down to 
speed your elephant. Or press fire and move the joystick to whip 
in the corresponding direction. 

Watch out for dirty tactics from your opponent, and don't go too fast 
for the ground underfoot. 


                       CAPTURING THE PALACE. 

You have captured the capital state of an empire, but your troops are 
still dealing with the remnants of the defeated armies (those who have 
not already run away). 

Then news reaches you that the former rulers are preparing to leave 
their palace and lead the vassal states of the empire against you. 
Unless you can reach the palace soon, you will find that you have 
captured the capital but lost the empire. 

You must make your way up the screen and enter the palace gates. 
Push the joystick in any of 8 directions to move, and push fire to 
shoot. Avoid the enemy bullets, and don't shoot women. 


                   BATTLE IN THE THUG TEMPLE. 

You rule all India and your armies, freed from the need to battle 
your rivals, are driving back the Thugs on all fronts. But the 
fight is far from won. The Thug priests are plotting a coup against 
your government tonight, and they could yet seize power unless you 
can stop them. There is no time to gather your troops. 

The only chance is for a lone attacker to creep into the last Thug, 
seize Kali's jewel which symbolizes their power, and escape safely 
with it. The Thugs obey whoever controls this artifact, so you will 
have broken their power forever. 

Find the statue of Kali, grab the jewel she guards (just walk up to 
it) and escape from the palace alive. Push the joystick in any of 8 
directions to move, and push fire to shoot. Avoid the Thugs and their 
knives. 


SWORD FIGHTS.  

I suspect that more Indian royalty have lost their lives to assassins 
than all the other causes of death put together. There are plenty of 
people who would like you to die suddenly and mysteriously. 

In the swordfight game, you need not control individual blows. Even if 
you were to do nothing but watch, your champion and his Thug opponent 
would attack and parry each other's blows roughly alternately. 

Control is by moving a highlight across a 3*3 grid... 

Left-to-right movement controls whether your hero tried to attack, 
stand or retreat. In turn, these affect the probability of parries 
working (retreating is safest, but a hero can only retreat so far).  

Up-down movement selects high, middle or low blows. Each opponent 
is more vulnerable to one attack type than the others, and your aim 
is to learn his weaknesses and exploit them. Press fire to replace 
the next blow (or parry) which the computer has picked for you by
the blow that you prefer. 

Keep a watch on the wounds you have suffered. If is better to retreat 
a little and live, than to attack valiantly and die of your injuries.

********************** Protection mechanism **************************

I propose that we print the silhouettes of Hindu gods in the 
documentation, each with his or her name. (Either at the corners of 
the booklet, or on a separate sheet). 

The game will occasionally display the shape of a god on the screen, 
and ask the player to enter his or her name. 

For greater anti-photocopying security, the god pictures could have 
a red pattern superimposed, and be viewed through a piece of red 
plastic film (perhaps mounted on card in the shape of prayer wheel).
