Dear Sirs, 

          Re: demo "Champion of the Raj" for ST/Amiga Format cover. 


1. I looked at the size of the current "strategy" part of the game 
   last night, and it is around 500K. (Raj is a BIG game). This is 
   mostly graphics data which - because it is already compressed - 
   will not squash down very much even if archived. 

2. Any version would therefore have to be a cut-down game (losing 
   some of the offices and events screens) and producing and testing 
   this would take more time that I would like to spend - and would 
   delay other work. I would rather continue finishing the full 
   "strategy" game, for delivery next week as agreed. 

3. I would be unhappy about launching the game without a musical score. 
   And, while work on this is underway, the music will not be ready 
   until towards the end of next month. 

Given the above, and the short schedule, I think it inadvisable to go 
ahead with a demo disk. 

                         Sorry,
