              Specification of "Champion of the Raj"    11/7/90 

The program will use Level 9's "HUGE" system to carry out the 
functions described in the "Champion of the Raj Design", which 
forms the major part of the Specification and must be read in 
conjunction with this schedule. 


                            Schedule  

The major remaining activities follow (remember that Level 9 have 
already spent a lot of time on the game if you add the numbers up)... 
* Loading sequence graphics (Dicon, 1 month, to 10/8/90)
* Enhancements to other graphics, as discussed with Mirrorsoft: 
  about 5 screens worth - more humorous cameos, princess, slavegirl, 
  nude statues etc. (Ken, 2 weeks. Dicon, 2 weeks, to 31/8/90) 
* Loading sequence animation (Richard, 3 weeks to 31/8/90) 

* Soundtrack music (Chris, 4 weeks to 31/8/90), plus about three 
  days from Mike to e.g synchronise it to the action 

* Strategy game, working with icon input, displaying the right 
  static screens (or a temporary one, if waiting for e.g princess 
  artwork) and reporting when arcade games should be called: 
                    (Pete, 2 weeks to 27/7/90) 

  Arcade games, which have already had a fair amount of work... 
* Tiger Shoot       (Pete, 1 week to   3/8/90) 
* Elephant Race     (Pete, 2 weeks to 24/8/90) 
* Swordfight        (Pete, 2 weeks to 31/8/90) 
* Army Battle       (Pete, 3 weeks to 21/9/90) 
* Capture Palace    (Graham, 3 weeks to 14/9/90) 

* Manual            (Pete, 2 days, by 31/7/90) 

The above assumes a single version, because Level 9's HUGE system 
produces genuinely portable games. Nevertheless, production of the 
three final versions will be say 3 days - with all members of Level 9 
helping out as needed.
