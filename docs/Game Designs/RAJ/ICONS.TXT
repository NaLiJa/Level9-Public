   ICONS FOR DEFENDER OF THE RAJ. Copyright (C) 1989 Level 9 

At the bottom right of the map (placed here because of the triangular 
shape of India) is a book. When you click on the map, pages turn in 
the book and it shows statistics of the state chosen: 

  ......................... Name of State .........................
   
  Defence : number of defenders      Infrastructure | Law and Order  
  Graphic : of state (including 5)   Graphic        | Graphic        
  --------+-----------------------   ---------------+--------------    
  Attack  : number of unassigned     Wealth         : number of money
  Graphic : troops in the empire     Graphic        : in treasury 

The defence and attack graphics show fortifications and troops/weapons 
respectively. The pictures reflect fighting spirit (military level). 

The infrastructure graphics vary from a particularly poor bullock cart 
to a splendid railway locomotive. Law and order varies from a ruin to 
a smart policeman. And wealth, which reflects square root (income/10), 
is an appropriately sized pile of treasure. 

Click on any part of the book you want to know more about: e.g name for 
a description of the state, or the defence graphic to learn which number 
it represents (and, if it's your turn and your state, to learn the 
cost of increasing the number and to be given the chance of doing so). 
These details are reported on a window, decorated by the head of the 
Hindu servant who is assumed to be giving the report.  


Icons (graphics) are 1 cell high (16 pixels) and 2 cells wide. 
State names and the numbers are in an ornate-ish typeface 7 or 8 
pixels high. Numbers are probably just printed, but we probably 
need the 25-odd state names in graphics which follow the slight 
curves of the book. 

The overall book is three or four cells high, so it might be 
possible to cell-align the icons. But this doesn't look right in 
practice, because the icons tend to be too cramped together 
vertically, so only the upper or the lower icons are aligned,
leaving a gap of about 8 pixels between them. 

There are ten alternative icons in each position, reflecting the 
increasing wealth and stability of a state. These are..

Animation. I don't want heavy animation of the book icons, but 
"twinkles" are vital for the gold and gems. A few other low-key 
animations are probably also desirable, but don't go over the 
top and have e.g puffs of smoke from the engines.
