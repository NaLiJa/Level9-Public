Dear Bob, 

         Following your conversation with Mike yesterday, I thought 
it would minimise the risk of any possible confusion if I sent you 
a typed version of Level 9's plans for "It Came From The Desert".         

Congratulations on getting the Amiga version out so fast, by they 
way. I had assumed that the strategy game would require a few weeks 
to finish, but your team obviously all work very hard. And the game 
seems a good one. 

We could argue about whether the "clock" has started on Level 9's 
deadline, but we definitely have enough data to start work on the 
project and have done so. 


Level 9's approach will be as follows: 

GRAPHICS. Some picture files are almost empty (typically those 
containing animation frames) and we are starting by merging these 
to keep the total number of files more manageable. 

Next, we will reduce the graphics to 16 colour, using an EGA 
palette (which is the main way the pictures will be seen). 

And finally we'll produce alternative palettes, to improve the 
colours for MCGA and VGA etc, and at the other extreme to allow 
display of satisfactory graphics in mono and 4-colour CGA. 


ARCADE GAMES will be re-coded using Level 9's system, so as to 
get the maximum possible speed on computers which do not have 
the Amiga's advantages as regards graphics hardware. 


THE STRATEGY GAME will NOT be recoded (this would be far too risky, 
as the story logic is complex and the time too short). We will 
definitely use the game logic data, and will will try to also use 
the C routines which read it; incorporating this strategy code 
directly in the other versions of the game. Fortunately C is fairly 
portable, and the code is well written (though we would have liked 
more comments!). 




















The routines to load pictures etc will be replaced, text will be 
compressed etc., but the heart of the game should thus be the same 
on all versions. 


BUGS. Needless to say, Level 9 will do our best to avoid introducing 
bugs into the program, and will try to fix any found. 

The question of any existing bugs from the Amiga version is trickier. 
I'm sure Cinemaware have tried to produce a bug-free product, but 
the game is sufficiently complex that a few may remain. 

In the end, it should be your decision as to whether bugs are fixed, 
as it may be better to leave minor bugs in place - in order that all 
versions of the game go wrong consistently. 

Bugs in the strategy game (e.g if Dr Wells still returns from the 
dead) can probably only be safely fixed by Cinemaware, and we'll 
incorporate the new date if you decide to change it. 

Spelling mistakes (if any) can be fixed here, if desired. 

I don't expect any real bugs in animated graphics and arcade games, 
but we'll fix any we learn of while re-coding.  


HELP. Mike has already faxed Randy Platt about what we would like, 
but here it is in a slightly neater form: 

* Released version of the strategy game, as soon as it is ready. 

* The bits and pieces needed to so that we have the complete Amiga 
  source. We don't need "MovE", but would like the Sonix driver and 
  MAKE files etc. 

* Source formats of data files. (I am told, for example, some of 
  the data on the Amiga still contains text comments, and it may 
  be that we can pre-process the files to save space). Data files 
  include the Maps (desert and hospital) and the game logic. 

* Source format of music. 


                       Many thanks,
