RE THE GRANGE MURDERS CONTRACT


DEAR SAM,
      YOUR LAWYER'S NEW VERSION OF THE CONTRACT ARRIVED TODAY AND WE HAVE
SPENT MOST OF THE DAY GOING OVER IT IN DETAIL. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT
THE ADDITIONS - AND SOMETIMES OMMISIONS - THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, TO ME, 
CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT.
      A LARGE NUMBER OF THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE SPECIFICALLY CONTRADICT
EXPLICIT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US IN THE COURSE
OF THIS NEGOTIATION. I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND MY FRUSTRATION THAT 
THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A CONTRACT THAT YOU YOURSELF WERE CONFIDENT WAS
OVER AND DONE WITH.
      LET ME MAKE MY PERSONAL POSITION CLEAR. LEVEL 9 AND CINEMAWARE CAN
BE VERY GOOD FOR EACH OTHER. LEVEL 9 HAS ALREADY MADE A LARGE COMMITMENT
TO CINEMAWARE IN BOTH TIME AND MONEY.
      THE DESIGN OF GRANGE HAS BEEN CHANGED IN LINE WITH THE CINEMAWARE 
STYLE OF PRESENTATION AND PHILOSOPHY - AS YOU YOURSELVES REQUESTED THE 
GAME TO BE A CINEMAWARE TITLE.
      IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT, A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMING EFFORT HAS
BEEN PUT INTO FURTHER IMPROVING THE SPEC OF THE GENERIC GAME SYSTEM - NOT
ONLY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE FLEXIBLE FOR GRANGE (SHOULD ANY CHANGES NEED
TO BE MADE FROM THE US END) BUT IN ORDER THAT "IT CAME FROM THE DESERT"
COULD BE SPEEDILY AND COMPETENTLY PROGRAMMED FOR PC, ST AND OTHER FORMATS.
      I HONESTLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE. WE HAVE 
ALREADY MADE A MASSIVE COMMITMENT TO YOU - BUT STILL NEW CONDITIONS OCCUR,
MANY CONTRADICTORY TO AGREEMENTS ALREAY MADE.
      WE UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION RE GUARANTEES AND HAVE ACCOMODATED
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY ON THAT ISSUE. THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL POINTS
WE SHALL NOT CHALLENGE ON THE LATEST VERSION OF THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE
ARE REASONABLE PEOPLE AND WANT TO GET THE CONTRACT SIGNED, OUT OF THE WAY,
AND GET ON WITH PROGRAMMING GREAT GAMES!
      HOWEVER, IT IS ALMOST AUGUST - AND WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS SINCE
MARCH. WE WENT OVER ON YOUR INVITATION IN EARLY MAY AND FIXED A DEAL THEN
EXPECTING TO SIGN SOMETHING A WEEK OR SO AFTER. THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO
DRAG FOR REASONS I FIND HARD TO PIN DOWN.
      I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE GRANGE PROJECT AND
BUSINESS THAT MAY FOLLOW ON FROM THAT IS STILL UNBOUNDED! BUT....IF WE
CAN'T AGREE ON SIMPLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.....
      I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF EVERYONE OVER AT CINEMAWARE IS STILL AS KEEN
ABOUT GRANGE AND THE AA SYSTEM AS THEY WERE. IF ANYONE HAS GOT SERIOUS
RESERVATIONS LET'S HAVE THEM OUT AND RESOLVE THEM - IF IT TAKES A FACE
TO FACE MEETING, SO BE IT.
      BUT AT THIS STAGE I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF WE CAN'T SIGN THIS 
CONTRACT BY MONDAY AUGUST 7TH, THEN I FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TAKING THE
PRODUCT AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM, ELSEWHERE.
      THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT, HOLDING A GUN TO YOUR HEAD. YOU AND I HAD
A FINAL AGREEMENT OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. IT HAS BEEN, WITHOUT YOUR
KNOWLEDGE I PREDICT, SIGNIFICANLY ALTERED, YET AGAIN. OUR FINAL COPY WAS 
A FAIR AND HONOURABLE DOCUMENT. SMALL CHANGES TO ACCOMODATE A LAWYER'S 
PRIDE ARE FINE. BASIC CHANGES, AFTER SO LONG, COMMUNICATE SOMETHING ELSE
TO ME. 
      LET'S GET THIS FIXED, SAM. I STILL HAVE VERY GOOD FEELINGS ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITIES A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVEL 9 AND CINEMAWARE. IT WOULD
BE A HELL OF A WASTE FOR ALL THAT WORK AND POTENTIAL TO GO DOWN THE DRAIN.

      I SUGGEST YOU PHONE ME AT LEVEL 9 AFTER YOU READ THIS SO WE CAN TALK
SOME MORE.
