A good computer game must have a popular subject, be in a popular 
genre, and have great graphics:  
* When searching for a subject, b-movies are a good place to look, as 
  Cinemaware and others have found so successfully in the past. With a 
  big budget you can make a successful film out of virtually anything 
  by adding enough gloss and special effects, you see, but a cheapo 
  move lives or dies by its theme and script. So the subject must be 
  something that will pull in the crowds. 
* A genre? Sierra sell masses of their 3D walk-about adventures, yet 
  Level 9's H.U.G.E system knocks spots off them in every way. 
* Graphics? Ancient Egypt really had style. 

Put them all together and what do you have?... 

                   THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB!
