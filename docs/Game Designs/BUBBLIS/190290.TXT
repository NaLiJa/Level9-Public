Dear Ian, 

        Sorry about the delay. I lost your address until this 
weekend, and then wanted to delay until I had the title screen all 
planned out. 

I wanted to use some kind of human figure on the loading screen, 
but was worried about sexism if I just used a mermaid. I think that 
balancing a mermaid with a hunky Poseidon will keep everyone happy. 

Other details are summarised on the enclosed design outline. 

In addition to the loading screen, I think we need the following: 
* bursing small/large bubbles; 
* revised combination of 4 bubbles into one big one;          
* additional frames for fish turns, where there is only 1 frame 
  between swiming right and swimming left; 
* water snail; 
* "monochrome" fishes to blow the game bubbles; 
* small "monochrome" bubbles being blown; 
* remaining cat animation. 

I enclose a cheque for #2.50and look forward to your next disk. 

                            Best wishes, 


                                        Pete Austin
