                THE INHERITANCE (working title) 

The Inheritance is about a young person fighting for their 
inheritance and life against a scheming Uncle and Aunt, deadly 
traps, disbelieving friends, ghostly and terrible apparitions and 
a demonic force locked in the rocks below the old house.

The style of game is a "first person", mouse icon\micon driven 
adventure giving a sense of being in the picture. A control panel 
scrolling up with animated icons from below the main picture 
allows for any interaction not handled by the pointer that changes 
as the situation develops and can also be animated (when a flaming 
torch is carried perhaps) or will change to a directional arrow 
near an exit, a magnifying glass when there is something to examine 
and a hand to operate an object. To talk to a person just click on 
the person. If there is to be a conversation the character then 
appears in their own speech bubble, animated and articulate. The 
Inheritance is made for Level Nines H.U.G.E. system, with its 
3D animation facilities and the large animated sprites and detailed 
and atmospheric colourful characters.
                    
                             CONTROL

An example would be if a detail of the frieze is clicked on, a 
secret panel will creak open and with a series of squeaks a bat will 
fly out and flutter around the head of the hero. When the pointer 
is moved to the now open aperture, an arrow will appear showing 
the opening as an exit. Clicking will then the move you inside the 
secret passage. If you wish to communicate with one of the many 
characters, click on the person and a speech window will appear next 
to them. If the pointer passes over an item of interest it changes 
to a magnifying glass and a click with the mouse or joystick 
fire button will lead to the item being set out in it's own window 
and described with an animated icon of a hand to get and further 
examination will trigger an unexpected action. If the pointer moves 
over an exit it will change to an arrow confirming the direction out 
and a click will take you to the next scene. As a further example if 
when confronted by a door; when the pointer is over the doorknob the 
pointer will animate as a turning hand, when over the bell pull as a 
pulling hand and over the rest of the door as an animated knocking 
hand. Should the pointer show a held key positioning the key over 
the lock and clicking will show the key turning in the lock and the 
door opening. Moving the pointer away from the object examined will 
turn the pointer to a "return" icon which when clicked takes you out 
or back to the main scene. Objects carried, save, load and all other 
commands are called by moving the pointer to the bottom of the 
screen and and clicking when the pointer turns into a menu icon. The 
menu window will scroll up over the main screen showing extra 
commands and objects carried, status reports, and a summary of the 
action so far.

                          STORY OUTLINE

The story is set in Cornwall in 1810,the period of the English 
Regency. The hero\heroine can be male or female and some of the 
responses changed accordingly. In this story all the rich folklore 
and legends of that storm swept coastline are mixed with a search 
for treasure and the secret of Hernehowe Manor. Set on the cliffs 
over the rolling Atlantic, unquiet spirits roam the old house, In 
the village smugglers and highway men lurk. Over Bodmin Moor the 
Black Coach rattles towards the gaunt pile that the hero has 
inherited. Nearby a bell tolls in the chapel rumoured to be built 
by the feared and tainted Knights Templars. Sheep have been found 
torn apart and the village fears that the same fate has befallen a 
young maid that worked at the Manor.

The village people are close but can be won over and talked to and 
questioned. Along the dark cobwebbed corridors of the granite house, 
eldrich and horrifying shapes swirl and hide, not easily killed as 
they are the undead with unfulfilled missions. Can the hero survive 
long enough to trace the source of the malignity?

Ghosts are laid to rest or destroyed in various ways. For example 
The Wet Woman of the Green room can be destroyed by luring her out 
into the garden on a cold night until she freezes and then letting 
the morning sun fall on her. A ghost that haunts a bricked up 
kitchen the needs to be reunited with the ghost of the Immured Nun 
in the cellar. The hero must find the way to the secret chamber and 
take a rock from the wall. Take the rock which the ghost can 
safely haunt to the Nun (if you can find her) and they will both 
be able to help in future when The Gratte Pit is discovered. And 
destroyed! 

                              STORYLINE

The hero has been brought up as an orphan by an elderly couple and 
the money for this has been supplied by a trust set up by the family 
lawyer on the disappearance at sea of 4the parents. On the 
seventeenth birthday of the hero, he/she is given their 
inheritance. A ring with an inscription, a purse of gold and a 
visit to a solicitor/lawyer. He informs that Hernhowe Manor plus 
the adjoining lands are now the hero's and hands over the key along 
with the condition that the hero must reside in the house for a 
week else all of the house and lands revert to an uncle that had 
emigrated to Canada. Arrangements are made to take the hero down 
by coach. As the hero travels down through Devon all the passengers 
leave until the hero is the only one left. On Bodmin Moor the hero 
changes coaches at a small Granite posting house and so hears of 
the troubles of Kernebarrow Village and the strange goings on. A 
small trap and pony arrives driven by the local Vicar (a friend 
of the Lawyer) and so the hero arrives at the house as night is 
falling and a great storm sweeps in off the Atlantic.

The game lasts for one `game week` and during the day the hero may 
question people and explore the old house which has been seeded 
with traps and devilish devices. At night alone in the house he\she 
must survive the onslaught of the ghosts and ghastly visitations of 
the undead. The hero will discover (if he\she survives) that 
there is an younger sibling and the plot revolves around the point 
that the hero must die first before the younger person can inherit. 
Should the younger person die before it`s Seventeenth birthday the 
house and lands (rich in a rare vein of Cornish gold) will pass 
to to the uncle. The younger sibling is restrained in the ruined 
east wing by the housekeeper and this has been blocked off and 
protected by numerous traps and demons.

                               SUMMARY

This game with its brooding atmospheric graphics and many 
interactive animated characters, both living and dead, all easily 
accessed by the ever-changing pointer will appeal to both the first 
time player and the more seasoned gamer. All the graphics will be 
large and detailed, showing well in either a shop window with a 
repeat intro or in a magazine review. The game supports a Roland 
board for excellent sound effects and Music.
