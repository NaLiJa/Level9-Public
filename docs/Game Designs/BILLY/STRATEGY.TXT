  STRATEGY GAME FOR BILLY THE KID. Copyright (C) Level 9 Computing  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 


The game is between Billy the Kid and Marshall Pat Garrett (neither, 
either or both of whom are controlled by the player(s)). 

Billy the Kid must recruit an outlaw gang and revenge his friend 
Tunstall, murdered in the "Lincoln County war", by robbing the 
opposing ranchers of all their animals and money. 

Pat Garrett was not associated with the "war", and is concerned 
only with law and order. He must deputise volunteers, stop crimes, 
and put Billy and the other outlaws in jail. 

The map shows Lincoln County (the SE quarter of New Mexico) and the 
surrounding areas...

START POSITIONS. Billy and Pat start at the Tunstall Ranch and at 
Roswell respectively. There is 1 outlaw at each of the Tunstall and 
Chisum ranches, 1 deputy at each of the other ranches, and one of 
each at the five towns in New Mexico. 

There is a herd of cows to steal at each of the ranches with 
deputies, and a possible crime at each New Mexico town - although
only a random two of these are imminent at any time. 


PLAY SEQUENCE: 
 Billy moves; Billy does things in his destination; 
 Sheriff Pat Garrett moves; Pat does things in his destination; 
 Possee(s) move; Possee(s) fight if they have caught up with Billy; 
 Crime "moves" to different random town if just committed/prevented; 
 Deputy appears in random town (1-6: if empty); 
 Possee appears in ranch if its cows have just left;  
 Deputy appears in random town (if empty). 


MOVING. Only Billy and Pat (and any men they take along with them) 
are moved by the players. When moving, they can choose to either 
stay where you are (which ends moving for that turn), or else go to 
an adjacent location (north-south, east-west or diagonally). 

Moving into occupied or friendly locations.. 
* Pat cannot enter Mountains occupied by outlaws, for fear of ambush. 
* If your destination is countryside (not Town or Fort) occupied by 
  enemies, your move only succeeds if you outnumber them by at least 
  2:1 (Billy or Pat count as 1). In this case, outlaws are captured 
  or scattered at random into unoccupied neighbouring locations as 
  Pat wishes, while deputies are killed. 
* If your destination is occupied by friends (fellow outlaws/deputies, 
  or the Tunstall/Chisum ranches for Billy, or either Fort for Pat) 
  you collect fresh horses and can move again. 

Leading people or animals..
* Billy and Pat decide, before every individual move, how many 
  outlaws/deputies respectively of those in the same location they 
  want to move. Any others are left behind. Thus if Billy or Pat are 
  making several moves that turn, by repeatedly collecting fresh 
  horses, they can leave or collect up a whole series of men. Outlaws 
  and deputies elsewhere cannot be moved voluntarily.  
* Cows are left behind if Billy goes to Town, Fort or Mountain. 
* Pat Garrett has no choice but to take arrested outlaws with him. 
  If these outlaws ever outnumber Pat and his deputies there to 
  guard them, they all escape and immediately join Billy. Likewise, 
  if Pat tries to keep the captured outlaws for too long - five turns 
  have gone past since he captured the last of them - they all escape. 
  Pat should leave captured outlaws at the state prison in Santa Fe. 

Movement restrictions.. 
* The Rio Grande is impassible, but the Pecos River is just scenery. 
* Pat Garrett cannot leave New Mexico, e.g to visit El Paso. 

Moving possee(s).. 
* Billy's second and subsequent ranch robbery cause a possee of 
  vigilantes to form at the end of the turn. A possee is of 10 men. 
  They will always attack Billy if possible, but will simply kill 
  one outlaw and disband if their attack is at worse than 2:1 odds. 
  Their move is after those of Billy and Pat. 
* A possee heads towards Billy, normally following his trail, 
  unless it can move to a location which "covers" more of Billy's 
  possible next moves than this.  
* A possee disbands after 6 turns, or if it moves onto mountain. 


DESTINATION. 



BETWEEN TURNS. 
* each turn, shake 1-6. 1-5 creates a new deputy in the corresponding 
  New Mexican town, providing the town is empty. 


                            SCORING AND WINNING 

Billy the Kid scores for: 
* Committing crimes in town 
* Selling cows in El Paso 
* Killing Pat 

Sheriff Pat Garrett scores for: 
* Preventing crimes in town 
* Each outlaw captured, each outlaw jailed, and each still in jail  
* Killing Billy 

The game ends when Billy or Pat is dead. A final gunfight between 
them is triggered when Billy has bankrupted the Murphy-Dolan faction 
by committing at least 5 robberies and sold all 5 sets of cows in 
El Paso, or when Pat has prevented 10 robberies.
