                    The Legend of Billy The Kid 

"The noted desperado of the Southwest, whose deeds of daring and blood 
made his name a terror in New Mexico" - Sheriff Pat F. Garrett


Despite a hundred years of speculation, nobody knows for sure where 
Billy the Kid was born. But in 1856 the infant Henry McCarty (this was 
Billy's original name) and his mother were living near Indianapolis. 

Mrs McCarty moved West soon afterwards, seeking a dry climate for her 
health, and married a man called Antrim. (Which explains why Billy 
was sometimes called Kid Antrim). Billy was raised in New Mexico at 
Silver City, about 100 miles (140 km) west of Mesilla on the game map. 

Billy grew up no worse than any boy of that time; he seems to have 
been fairly honest, and fairly hardworking. But then events conspired 
to outlaw him. Either, to quote Pat Garrett, "as Billy's mother was 
passing,... a filthy loafer in the crowd made an insulting remark" 
and he was forced into a fight where the man died. Or, according to 
the Grant County Herald, Billy was framed for theft - allegedly as a 
"joke" - but did not trust the court to find him innocent and made 
the first of his many escapes from jail. 

In either event, Billy fled across the border to Arizona and started 
the period of his life that has since become legendary - stealing 
horses, consistently winning at cards, winning the hearts of the 
ladies, and backing down for no man. This all ended when Billy shot 
a soldier blacksmith in Adkins' dance hall, Bonito. The killing was 
probably self-defence but, with the army after him, Billy left Arizona 
and returned to Lincoln County, New Mexico - where he called himself 
William Bonney and settled down to live honestly. 

Meanwhile, conflict was brewing in Lincoln County. Two dishonest 
businessmen, Murphy and Dolan, having made a fortune cheating 
Reservation Indians, now ran the only store in Lincoln City. Murphy 
and Dolan charged extortionate prices for their goods, but paid poor 
farmers next to nothing for their crops. So honest men were being 
forced into bankruptcy, while Murphy and Dolan and their rancher 
friends were rapidly taking control of the area. 

The main threat to this evil monopoly was John H Tunstall, a recent 
immigrant from the English-Scottish border. He had established a 
ranch nearby and, with Alexander McSween, opened a competing store in 
town - charging fair prices. Most of the locals were delighted, but 
inevitably, Murphy and Dolan reacted with threats of violence. 

When Billy learned what was going on, he was impressed by Tunstall's
plans to help the local people and accepted the job of leading 
Tunstall's men. Thus it came about that, when Tunstall was murdered 
in 1878 by a hired gunman, Billy set out to revenge him... 


Computer Requirements: 
* IBM PC, Tandy 1000, Amstrad PC or any other 100% compatible. 
* MS-DOS version 2.1 or later (type MS-DOS command "VER"). 
* 360K (5 1/4") or 720K (3 1/2") floppy disk drive(s). 
* 512K of RAM, or more. 
* VGA, EGA, CGA colour, CGA black-and-white, MCGA, or Tandy TGA 
  graphics, with a suitable monitor. 

Optional Equipment: 
* Hard disk drive. The game is at its best if installed on hard disk. 
* Second floppy disk drive, of the same size, is strongly recommended 
  if you intend to run the game from floppy disk, rather than hard 
  disk. This means two disks can be read by the computer at a time, 
  and disk swapping will be minimized. 
* An average or fast PC. A computer even less powerful than a PC XT 
  (8086 and 8mhz clock speed) is not recommended. You can slow down 
  the game on a fast PC, but not speed it up on a slow one. 
* Joystick plugged into the game port (as Joystick "A" if you have 
  a twin adaptor). 
* Mouse (you also need to have installed your mouse driver software 
  before running the game). 
* 640K of RAM. The game will happily use up to 640K of memory if this 
  is available. (It is normally also a good idea to use a disk cache 
  utility, such as Microsoft's SmartDrive, which uses extended memory 
  and reduces the need for disk reads. But on a 512K machine, such 
  utilities may be counter-productive, as they also take some main 
  memory better used by the game's own cache utilities. For similar 
  reasons, it is sensible not to load TSRs into memory before playing 
  the game). 
* Roland, AdLib, or Sound Blaster music card. If you play a lot of 
  games but have not yet got one of these boards, we strongly recommend 
  that you buy one. We were amazed at the difference they make. 


Before Playing: 
* Please use the MS-DOS "TYPE" command to read the file README.TXT on 
  one of the game disks (probably the first). This contains the most 
  up to date information on your particular version. 
* Anti-virus note: Never, ever unprotect your original "The Legend of 
  Billy the Kid" disks. If your computer asks you to do this, it could 
  be because a virus is trying to copy itself onto them. 


Starting "The Legend of Billy the Kid" for the first time: 
* Boot your PC with DOS version 2.1 or higher, place the first game 
  disk in drive A: (or drive B:) 
* Type... 
  A:               (or B:) 
  BILLY 
* Use keypad keys 2 ( ) and 8( ) to choose a display type from the 
  list. Then press Enter ( ). (If there are several display types 
  which all seem suitable, e.g there is more than one reference to 
  VGA, choose the first one by preference. If this then gives 
  problems during play, it may mean your PC is not 100% compatible 
  and you should try again with a later equivalent from the list.) 
* In the same way, choose: 
  "Joystick On", or "Joystick Off"; 
  "Mouse On", or "Mouse Off" (to use a mouse, you must have installed 
  appropriate mouse driver software before running the game); 
  "Roland", "AdLib", "Sound Blaster", or "Music Off"; 
  "Sound Effects On" or "Sound Effects Off". (Sound effects can slow 
  the game noticably on a slow PC).
  "Play Game", or "Install on Hard Disk". (If you choose hard disk, 
  the game next asks you for the disk name: enter e.g C: ). 
* An animated introduction sequence follows, taking about five minutes. 
  To skip it, press any key. At the end of this introduction, the game 
  pauses and asks you to press a key; do so, or else it will repeat the 
  introduction over again. 


Starting "The "Legend of Billy the Kid" on hard disk: 
* The first time, follow the instructions above. 
* Next time, type 
  C:         (or the drive you installed it on)
  CD \OCEAN
  BILLY
  and the game will run without needing to ask you for all its
  configuration information. 

                           Playing the Game 


Control Methods: 
This manual describes how to play "The Legend of Billy the Kid" 
entirely with a joystick, but there are three alternatives... 
* Joystick: push it in the appropriate direction and press "fire" 
  to act.  
* Mouse: on menus and maps, use it as you normally would; elsewhere, 
  move the mouse slightly in the same direction as described for the 
  joystick and press the left button for "fire". 
* Numeric keypad: this is used like a joystick; press keys to move 
  (8=up, 9=up right, 6=right, 3=down right, 2=down, 1=down left, 
  4=left, 7=up left). To "fire" press 5, Enter or the space bar. 

Some of the game is controlled by menus. Steer the highlight up and 
down with e.g the joystick and press fire to select an option. 

Also within the game are nine different types of Wild West action. 
Instructions for these are displayed on the screen the first time you 
encounter each of these - read them and press "fire". 

The following are special functions, controlled from the keyboard, that 
work on most (but not necessarily all) screens: 
* The + and - keys adjust game speed. 
* The M key toggles the music on or off (providing you did not select 
  "Music Off" when starting the game). 
* The P key pauses the game; press R (resume) or C to continue. 
* The S key toggles sound effects on or off (providing you selected 
  "Sound Effects On" when starting the game). 
* Control C quits from the game. 


Objectives of the game: 
The game starts when Billy the Kid and Sheriff Pat Garrett witness 
the murder of their friend Tunstall by a gunman from the evil Murphy- 
Dolan gang of ranchers; an event which leads to a permanent breach 
between the two friends. 
* If playing Sheriff Pat Garrett, you believe that the only solution to 
  such atrocities is to bring law to Lincoln County. You pledge to hunt 
  down all law-breakers, whoever they may be. 
* But if playing Billy the Kid, you believe that law is powerless 
  against rich men such as Murphy, Dolan and their friends. No judge 
  would convict them, so justice will have to come from the barrel of 
  your gun. 

Your first big decision is which to choose: Billy or Pat? 
* As Billy the Kid, you must get revenge for your friend, and drive 
  the guilty ranchers from the territory by shooting and robbing them 
  of all they own. 
* Or as Sheriff Pat Garrett, you must bring law by tracking down the 
  outlaw gangs which abound in lawless Lincoln County, even though 
  this will finally mean confronting your former friend, the man who 
  gets to be the most dangerous outlaw of them all: Billy the Kid! 

If you chose Pat, please jump ahead to "A SHERIFF'S LIFE", but if you 
chose Billy the Kid then carry on reading... 

                           BEING AN OUTLAW 

There's a lot to be said for an outlaw's life: you have freedom, as 
much money as you can spend, and are respected by everyone you can 
outdraw (and that means practically everyone). 

But old outlaws are about as common as honest politicians; unless you 
keep alert and spend your money on your friends, eventually some young 
punk is going to get lucky and claim that reward on your head. 

Your aim is to kill or bankrupt all of the Murphy-Dolan faction: the 
ranchers and cowboys responsible for murdering your friend Tunstall. 
When you manage this, or if your crimes make the sheriff look so bad 
that he is thrown out of office, the game ends in a duel with Pat 
Garrett. 

Your score is your reputation, which increases with: 
* every crime committed, with bigger scores for bigger crimes (This 
  also increases the price on your head, and hence the number of 
  bounty hunters pursuing you),  
* every enemy killed or driven from the state, 
* doing good deeds, e.g defending a widow's land. 

Crimes. The Murphy-Dolan faction are dishonest businessmen and 
ranchers, who normally hide their cowardly carcasses behind the guns 
of hired hands. So you can't normally attack them directly, but you can 
certainly hit them where it really hurts their kind - in their pockets. 
You can commit a variety of crimes: bank robbery, cattle rustling, 
train robbery, and (if they come out of hiding) sometimes use your gun. 

If you just commit crimes randomly, you are unlikely to do well. Most 
banks hold little money most of the time, most trains are not 
carrying gold shipments, and so on. And, what is worse, each crime 
encourages the target to buy a bigger safe and hire more guards for 
next time. 

As Billy, you need to talk to local people, and meet up with other 
outlaws, in order to learn which are the most profitable targets for 
crime. Not everyone is worth talking to; some people are liars; and 
some of them need bribes or other help before they will help you in 
return. So be generous with your money and considerate to the poor.  


MAP OF LINCOLN COUNTY: 
You begin the game on a map of Lincoln County, New Mexico, 1878. 

Use the joystick to move a "binoculars" cursor across the map (which 
scrolls if you try to go off the edge) and press fire when it is 
looking at the a place you are interested in. This expands the 
binoculars, to give a closer view of the place, and you can either 
press fire again to go there - or else move the cursor aside to stay 
with the map. 

Visiting a place sometimes gives you a big picture of it, with a 
menu to enter commands and probably someone in the foreground to 
talk to. Take care how you deal with people in the game; they each 
have their own personality and some will be willing to help you 
with information - especially if you help them out with their 
problems. 

Other places lead you straight into an action sequence. For example, 
if you visit a ranch that is well guarded by enemies, you will get 
involved in a shootout. And if you visit a town, you will find 
yourself on Main Street and can walk or ride about to visit the 
buildings there. 

In one corner of the map is a "timeout" icon. Press fire on this to 
enter timeout (pause) mode, which stops time passing and opens a menu 
to allow you to Continue, Save, Load, Quit or Restart. (If you intend 
to Save your position to floppy disk, you need to have formatted a 
blank disk before playing the game). 


LOS PORTALES: 
This is the hideout of your gang, the Regulators, who began as cowboys 
employed by your friend Tunstall, and are now your loyal allies in the 
fight to revenge his death. Tom O'Foliard is your second in command, 
and their hideout is northeast of Fort Sumner. 

You need help to carry out crimes, and this means taking along a gang 
of outlaws. For example, it is impossible for a single person to herd 
cows, and a lone robber would be certain to get shot if he was the 
only outlaw escaping across town after a bank raid. 

You can ask any gang to go along, but the Regulators are the best. You 
would probably lead them on every robbery but for one snag - outlaws 
see no reason to risk their necks again until they have spent the 
proceeds of their last crime. You can't take it with you, so who wants 
to die with gold in his pockets? 


IN TOWN: 
When you select a town on the map, such as Lincoln City or Roswell, 
the screen changes to show you riding along Main Street and tying up 
your horse. To leave town, return to your horse and press fire to 
mount and ride off. 

Use the joystick to walk about, along the streets or into buildings. 
You can talk to some people, by walking up to them and pressing fire, 
though most will ignore you and some may be so annoyed that they 
challenge you to a duel. 

The Sheriff's Office is normally best avoided, as you will certainly 
get a hostile reception! But shop clerks can be useful sources of 
gossip, and it would be a poor outlaw who did not visit the saloon 
to buy a round of red-eye for everyone. The saloon is the best place 
to meet the local outlaws, to learn of any crimes they plan and 
perhaps to join in a game of cards. 

At the start of the game, there is a gang of outlaws for every town, 
and you should try to meet them. But be careful in any town where Pat 
has rounded up the local gang - people in law-abiding towns do not 
like outlaws, however well-intentioned. 


QUICK DRAW DUEL: 
Wait for the bell to ring, then steer the sights onto your opponent 
and fire. If you miss, your gun will jump aside, but you may be able 
to get in a second shot if you're quick. Your draw speed gets faster 
as your reputation increases. 


SHOOTOUT: 
Use the joystick to steer your gunsights across the screen, and press 
fire to shoot. Remember to duck! Press fire and pull the joystick back 
to duck down (which reduces the chance of being hit), and press fire 
and move up to rise again. While ducked, you can aim, but not yet fire. 


CATTLE RUSTLING: 
Your enemies are mostly ranchers, so stealing their stock is a sure 
fire way of getting back at them. Choose an enemy ranch on the map 
(preferably one which you have learnt is unguarded, but which has 
stock rounded up). The idea is that several horsemen round up the 
cows and herd them south across the Mexican border to sell (downwards 
on the screen). 

You control one horseman at a time: up/down speeds/slows the horse, 
left/right steers it, and fire transfers control to the next rider. 
Uncontrolled horsemen keep going in a straight line. 

The cows try to keep away from all the horsemen, and so can be herded 
fairly easily - but can you do it against the clock? There will be 
trouble if the posse catches you north of the border. 

Note that you can ride on both lowland and upland ground - as long as 
you can find a break in the cliffs, that is. 


TRAIN ROBBERY:
Choose the train on the map, if you know about a gold shipment. 
(Robbing trains is a dangerous activity, due to the persistence of 
railroad detectives, and no outlaw gang will go along with you unless 
they know the rewards are worth the risk). 

You wait where the train has to slow for an incline, then run 
alongside (left and right adjust your speed, and fire makes you 
jump over obstacles), jump to catch the ladder, then run along the 
carriage roofs to the engine - jumping the gaps between them. It's 
easier than it sounds! 


BANK ROBBERY: 
Enter the bank and choose the robbery option on the menu (if it's not 
there, this must be because you've not asked a gang to go with you). 

Move the joystick left or right to transfer dynamite from the pile to 
beside the safe. And press fire to light the fuse. 

Your problem is to work out how much dynamite to use for each safe. 


GETAWAY: 
If you rob a bank which is guarded by Pat or his deputies, they may 
try to ambush you on the way out of town. You just control your own 
horse (in the same way as when cattle rustling), but can shoot by 
pressing fire, or adjust your aim by pressing fire and simultaneously 
moving your joystick. It's every man for himself! 


CARDS: 
Use the menu to play. You are not likely to make much money while 
playing cards, but it's a useful way to meet people - even if you 
do often end up fighting them over alleged cheating. 


BAR ROOM BRAWL: 
When fighting, the joystick operates as follows, with brackets for 
the effect of pressing FIRE: 

     Sway back (High Block)\(High Block)/Forwards (High Punch) 
     Sway back (Block)     -  (Block)   -     Forwards (Punch) 
     Sway back (Low Block) /(Low Block) \  Forwards (Low Blow)



                         A SHERIFF'S LIFE  

In Wild West times, the sheriff and his deputies WERE the law. They 
could do pretty much as they liked, and it was truly said that the 
safest place for a murderer to hide was behind a badge. 

Fortunately for Lincoln County, Pat Garrett is pretty honest, by 
the standards of the time. He tried his hand at cattle rustling in 
the past, like many frontiersmen, but now he has settled down. 

As Pat, you are determined to clean up Lincoln County. No longer will 
"West of the Pecos" conjure up images of brawls and banditry! It will 
be a hard job, but your sworn mission is to hunt down every last outlaw. 

If you manage this, or if you jail Billy for a fifth time, the game 
ends in a duel with the most notorious outlaw of all, Billy the Kid. 

Your score is your reputation, which increases with: 
* each time Billy is captured (even though Billy escapes the first 
  four times), 
* every robbery thwarted by deputies on guard, 
* every outlaw gang defeated, whether or not Billy was involved, 
  and especially if they have recently committed notorious crimes, 
* every good deed done.  

Budget: From your base in the Lincoln City Sheriff Office, you 
control the law enforcement budget: hiring deputies (who guard 
robbery targets and discourage outlaws from coming into the town 
where they are placed), organize a posse and hire a tracker to hunt 
down outlaw hideouts. 

You could single-mindedly try to capture Billy, but this would mean 
letting other criminals run riot and probably get you voted out of 
office. So you must try to jail every outlaw gang in Lincoln County, 
meanwhile pleasing the public, making Billy's life harder and earning 
enough rewards to pay an elite tracker to hunt down Billy's hideout. 

If you position deputies at random, you may have some effect in 
reducing crime and catching outlaws, but it will not be great. The 
idea is to guard the most tempting targets - e.g the bank with the 
most money in its vault, or the ranch where all the cowboys are away 
rounding up stock. 

So you need as much information as you can get from local people. Not 
everyone is worth talking to; some people are liars; and some of them 
will ask for bribes (which you can ill-afford) or other help before 
they will help you in return. 

If you, or five deputies (out of the roughly ten that you can afford) 
are in town when a crime is committed, you get the chance to lead a 
posse and track the gang responsible to their lair for a shoot-out. 
But this is expensive, as posse members want bonuses and don't like 
taking casualties - and gangsters are less likely to venture into town 
when lawmen are around. So you should only guard very tempting targets. 

What is worse is that you will find that crime victims clamour for 
police protection (even though outlaws are hardly going to return to 
a newly-empty bank) and you may have to assign some of your scarce 
deputies to quieten them down.

the screen changes to show you riding along Main Street and tying up 
your horse. To leave town, return to your horse and press fire to

Use the joystick to walk about, along the streets or into buildings. 
You can talk to some people, by walking up to them and pressing fire, 
though most will ignore you and some may be so annoyed that they 
challenge you to a duel! 

The Sheriff's Office is the place to make for, as once inside you 
can talk to the deputy or perhaps examine the wanted posters on view. 
Shop clerks can be useful sources of gossip, especially in your 
hometown of Roswell, and it would be a poor outlaw who did not visit 
the saloon occasionally. You should probably avoid playing cards, 
however. 

At the start of the game, there is a gang of outlaws for every town, 
and you should try to track them down. Be careful in lawless towns, 
as people may not take kindly to the sheriff. 


QUICK DRAW DUEL, SHOOTOUT, CARDS, BAR ROOM BRAWL: 
See the instructions above. These games are exactly the same for both 
Pat and Billy. 


TRAIN RESCUE:
If you are in Santa Fe, there is a slight chance that an accident on 
the railway leads to a runaway train, heading for the town. 

You wait where the train has to slow for an incline, then run 
alongside (left and right adjust your speed, and fire makes you 
jump over obstacles), jump to catch the ladder, then run along the 
carriage roofs to the engine - jumping the gaps between them. 


GETAWAY: 
If you are in town when the local bank is robbed, you get to position 
barricades to hamper the outlaws' escape, and deputies on the roof 
tops to shoot them as they try to gallop away. Use the joystick to 
move the current barricade or deputy about, and press fire to place 
it or him, though you can't position anything too near the bank for 
fear of alerting the robbers to your preparations. 

When the outlaws swarm out and try to gallop away, your deputies fire 
automatically, while you can push the joystick to move "Pat" and press 
fire to shoot. 


TRACKING: 
Following a "GETAWAY", or if at least 5 deputies were on the scene 
when a crime was committed, you get the chance to track the guilty 
outlaws to their lair. 

In any Sheriff's Office, you should first hire a tracker and then 
decide how many deputies to take (they will each want a bonus). The 
better the tracker, the more time you have to find the outlaws (as he 
can follow a trail left long ago) and the more deputies, the better 
your chances in the shootout when you find the outlaws. 

In the tracking game, use the joystick to direct the tracker through 
a maze of canyons: as always, up/down speeds/slows the horse, and 
left/right steers it. Press fire and the tracker dismounts to examine 
the ground for evidence. 

Note that you will probably need to ride on both lowland and upland 
ground, so watch out for breaks in the cliffs.

  be because a virus is trying to copy itself onto them. 


Starting "The Legend of Billy the Kid"...  
* From floppy disk: insert the first disk and switch on your Amiga. 
* From hard disk: copy the contents of all the disks into a folder and 
  run it from there. Read the README file, too. 


********************** Protection mechanism **************************

As Colin Gordon seems to have a good knowledge of Wild West-type 
guns, we suggest you print silhouettes of these in the documentation, 
each with its name. (Either at the corners of the booklet, or on a 
separate sheet). 

The game will occasionally display the shape of a gun on the screen, 
and ask the player to enter its name. 

For greater anti-photocopying security, the gun pictures could have 
a red pattern superimposed, and be viewed through a bit of red 
plastic film (perhaps mounted on card in the shape of a gunsight).
