 "BILLY THE KID" - INTRO SEQUENCE SCRIPT. Copyright (C) 28/7/90 Level 9 

1. Streets of Bonito 
   * Buggy 1 (grey horses) enters right and trots left  
   * Buggy 2 (brown horses) enters when buggy 1 is about 1/3 of the 
     way across the screen, from the left and trots right 
   * Stagecoach enters as buggy 1 leaves, from the right and trotting 
     left. The driver occasionally uses his whip. 
   * As soon as the vehicles are clear, the dance hall window breaks 
     with a crash and Billy comes flying out. He lies on the ground 
     for a couple of seconds, before standing and walking back up to 
     the door. Cut immediately. 

2. Blacksmith in Doorway 
   * Billy stands motionless in foreground; double bar doors swing 
     open and are gone, revealing the blacksmith behind. (Make sure 
     the doors do not start too high - Billy is quite short - and 
     that we can see the blacksmith's right hand). 
   * The background dancers are static; the oil lamp flickers; the 
     blacksmith blinks. 
   * Blacksmith talks: "So, the mother-lover's back. Draw, you son of 
     a bitch". 
   * Blacksmith cocks his guns in their holsters and makes a move 
     to draw his right gun. Billy's gun appears in his hand with the 
     muzzle flash behind (this is instantaneous). Hold for 1-2 frames. 
   * Lose muzzle flash, but Billy's gun remains static. There is a red 
     patch above the blacksmith's heart and his eyes roll up. Cut 
     immediately. 

3. Streets of Bonito 
   * Dance hall doors are now open, but the blacksmith cannot be seen. 
   * Billy runs left off the screen. 
   * Billy reappears from the left, mounted on his trusty grey, and 
     gallops right across the screen. When he nears the right hand 
     side, the screen scrolls to follow him as far as it can. He exits. 
   * As Billy gallops by the dance hall, about three men appear in its 
     doorway and fire after him (this is shown by muzzle flashes and 
     hopefully sound effects). 
   * After a few seconds, four or five horsemen gallop across the 
     screen (which remains static at its extreme right scroll position) 
     from left to right. They occasionally fire into the air. 
   * Meanwhile, a small bird has been flying left-right above, and (if 
     it looks OK) a small cabin with windpump and smoking chimney sits 
     in the distance, halfway between the gallows and the right edge. 

4. Billy evades the posse 
   * four or five small horsemen (equivalents of the above) trot across 
     the screen from left-right in the distance. Meanwhile... 
   * An eagle swoops down from the top left, before rising and exiting 
     off the top right (this is a "pointer" towards Billy). 
   * Then Billy slides up in the foreground, remains there for a 
     while, then slides down slowly out of sight. 


5. Hoe Down 
   * Text: "Tunstall Ranch in Lincoln County, across the state line. 
   * Flames flicker, men drink at the tables, two fiddlers fiddle 
     out of sync, a banjo player strums, and perhaps 8 groups of 
     dancers dance in front of the fire. 
   * The dancers can promenade left and right, and they can spin 
     around, so I suggest a dance where they promenade for a couple 
     of cms, then spin, and repeat this perhaps three times. Then 
     they spin around 1 1/2 times and head back the way they came. 
   * Billy enters from the left, beyond everyone, lights a cigarette 
     (I know we used this in Grange, but it's the best way I can think 
     of to draw attention to him) and walks over to the farmhouse door. 
   * Farmhouse door opens and light shines out. Cut immediately. 

6. Pat and Tunstall talk 
   * Pat and Tunstall blink, the fire flickers, when each talks his 
     mouth moves and his eyebrows twitch a bit. 
   * Pat speaks, "... Murphy and Dolan are dangerous men, Mr Tunstall." 
   * A microphone boom dips down into the mirror, then up again. 
   * Tunstall speaks, "Their threats don't worry me, Sheriff Garrett. 
     I'm too angry about the way they are cheating the honest farmers". 
   * Billy's head scrolls up in the mirror. 
   * Pat's eyes turn towards the player, he grins and then speaks. 
     Immediately Pat's words are on the screen, Tunstall's head also 
     turns towards the player and the scene cuts. 
     Pat says, "Well, well! Here's someone who might just help. 
     Where've you been this past years, Billy? John Tunstall, meet 
     the Kid, an old friend of mine and a good man in a fight". 

7. Pat, Billy and Tunstall talk 
   * They all blink and very occasionally twitch their eyebrows. 
   * Tunstall speaks, "I'd like you to join my men, Billy. But I'm 
     right out of cash until I visit Lincoln City tomorrow, so 
     here's my lucky silver dollar on account. Keep it safe."  
   * Tunstall flicks the dollar into the air. Cut. (At the time of 
     writing, this dollar is the only graphic that we don't have). 

8. Buggy Ride 
   * Buggy and two riders enter left (the riders slightly in the lead) 
     and trot slowly across. 
   * As the riders are about to pass behind the tree on the right, 
     two white pigeons fly up in the foreground near the tree and flap 
     up and across the screen - leaving on the left. 
   * Tunstall leans back and his buggy stops, with his horse partly 
     hidden by the foreground tree. He points backwards. 
   * Text, "Pat, Billy, there goes dinner!" 
   * The two riders gallop back right-left across the screen, firing 
     into the air as they go, and exit left. 
   * The screen scrolls right to reveal a murderer behind the tree. Cut. 

9. Assassination of Tunstall 
   * Branches which partly hide buggy scroll left/right off screen, 
     revealing a bunny which meanwhile hops left-right across the gap. 
   * Murderer scrolls on from below. 
   * Murderer raises his guns and fires both (muzzle flashes). 
   * Tunstall slumps backwards in his seat. Cut. 

10. Pat and Billy lean over Tunstall's body 
   * They blink and very occasionally twitch their eyebrows. 
   * Pat speaks, "Another good man dead. I swear I'll bring law to 
     Lincoln County and hunt down every last outlaw". 
   * Billy speaks and we cut the scene and load the game itself: 
     "You're wrong. Murphy and Dolan paid for this killing, and I never 
     knew a rich man hung. If you mean what you said, you'll be hunting 
     me too. Because I vow revenge for John Tunstall and I'll do 
     whatever I must, to drive his murderers from this land.
