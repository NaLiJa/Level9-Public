The Chairman                                              23/1/90 
British Telecom Plc 
81 Newgate Street 


Dear Sir, 

         Regarding the contract between Level 9 Computing and 
British Telecom Plc, by which our games have been published under 
the "Rainbird" brand name. 

I have to inform you that BT's failure to comply with the provisions 
of this agreement within one month after written notice (my letter 
of 21/12/89, which was delivered to you by the following day) means 
that this contract has automatically terminated as set out therein. 

I believe that British Telecom Plc may have de facto contracts with 
early buyers of Rainbird games, however, and hope that there is no 
truth in tales that players who request the back-up promised in 
Rainbird packaging being rebuffed with "not known at this address" 
when they write to the Rainbird address in the booklets.  


         This is the last letter which I currently plan to write to 
BT, so it might end the conversation neatly if someone could write 
and (even at this late date) tell me whether BT's rights under the 
above contract were assigned while you still had them - and if so to 
who. I still find it strange that BT were not open about this at 
the start.  


                     Yours faithfully, 


                                      Pete Austin
