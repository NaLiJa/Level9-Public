Dear Sir or Madam, 


         I am having great difficulty persuading Bracknell Cable 
TV to accept the cancellation of our subscription with them. 

We have made six requests to to cancel our account there, most of 
which have simply been ignored; in the other two cases I was assured 
that the account had already been "cleared" - only to receive 
another bill shortly afterwards. 

As you will see from the address above (please use the one at the 
top right if you would like to contact me), we are no longer living 
in Bracknell and it is galling to receive ever increasing bills for 
a service to a house which we sold some time ago. 

I fully expect that BCTV's computer will take us to court, once the 
imaginary debt reaches some threshold. 


         Can you do anything to put a stop to this nonsense and 
persuade BCTV to trade in a responsible manner? 

I include a record of the correspondence, with copies of most of the 
documents, and look forward to the end of this matter. 



                       Yours faithfully, 



                                        Pete Austin 
                                        pp Mssrs Austin
