Dear Sir, 

         I am currently experiencing difficulty with an outlying 
part of the BT empire, namely Bracknell Cable TV. 

I have made repeated requests to to cancel my account there, most 
of which have been ignored, and have been twice assured that the 
account has been cancelled - only to receive another bill next month. 

1) Could you get someone to sort things out. 

2) I believe that my experience of BCTV is not untypical. As the 
   competence of any small part of BT must inevitably reflect on the 
   whole, I think you should check out how the place is being run. 


         I include a record of the correspondence, with copies of 
most of the documents, and look forward to the end of this matter. 
For further details, I can be contacted at the top right address. 


                       Yours faithfully, 



                                        Pete Austin
