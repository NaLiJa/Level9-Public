Dear Sirs/Madams, 


  Re: Account number 5257a for 11 Mendip Road, Bracknell; 
          May - Mike's letter cancelling the account; 
       1/6/89 - BCTV "Invoice" for #35; 
       3/6/89 - My letter cancelling the account; 
      15/6/89 - BCTV "Overdue Reminder" for #35; 
      22/6/89 - My recorded delivery letter cancelling the account; 
       3/7/89 - BCTV "Invoice" for #52.50; 
      Mid July- My letter, including a reminder of the cancellation; 
      27/7/89 - BCTV "Overdue Reminder" for #52.50; 
       1/8/89 - BCTV "Invoice" for #70;
      11/8/89 - My recorded delivery letter cancelling the account; 
      18/8/89 - BCTV: letter from John Rolls - account "cleared"; 
      23/8/89 - BCTV threat of legal action if I didn't pay #70; 
      26/8/89 - My recorded delivery letter: please clear account; 
       4/9/89 - BCTV phone call. Jenny Olsen arranged to collect 
                equipment and assured me the account was cleared; 
       5/9/89 - Decoder box collected by BCTV's agent; 
      13/9/89 - BCTV "Invoice" for #87.50.  

This has gone far beyond a joke, and I have sent copies of the 
relevant documents to your local trading standards office. It is 
clear that I cannot trust BCTV to cancel my account: even when 
your people tell me it's already been cancelled, it hasn't. 

Nevertheless, I shall repeat the request for a seventh time: 
       Please cancel account 5257A, as of May, as agreed. 

All correspondence must be to the address at the top right, as we 
moved away from Bracknell some months ago. 


                            Yours faithfully, 


                                             Pete Austin 
                                             for Mssrs Austin
