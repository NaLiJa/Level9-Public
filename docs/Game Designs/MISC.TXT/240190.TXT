Dear Sirs/Madams, 

                 I enclose the copy for a 6.5cm x 9cm advert, 
suitable for your classified section. Please keep it. 

This letter is not itself a booking for advertising space, but I 
may well book some if someone 'phones me with a reasonable offer. 
In the first instance, we are likely to want a single insertion to 
check response. 


                        Yours faithfully, 



                                         Pete Austin
