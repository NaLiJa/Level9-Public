Dear Sirs/Madams, 

                 Re: account 1603 674 011 072 at 11 Mendip Road, 
Bracknell, Berks RG13 3XG. 

We have just sold this house and moved. Completion is today, 12 
August 1989, I believe. 

The final meter readings are rather smaller than the estimates on 
your latest bill (5 July 1989), probably because the house has been 
virtually empty for the past few months. So, I will not pay this, 
but will send payment by return, when I get a revised final bill. 
(Please send it to the Southampton address). 

The final readings were:  8102  ECON7  DAY 
                          4946  ECON7NIGHT 


                     Yours faithfully, 


                                      Pete Austin
