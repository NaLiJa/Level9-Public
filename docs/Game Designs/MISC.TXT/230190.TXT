Dear Sirs/Madams, 

                 I enclose the copy for a 6.5cm x 9cm advert, 
suitable for your jobs section. Please keep it. 

This letter is not itself a booking for advertising space, but 
I may well book some if someone 'phones me with a reasonable 
offer. We are likely to want either a single insertion (to check 
response), or else an intermittent series. 


                        Yours faithfully, 



                                         Pete Austin
