Dear Chris & David, 


           RESPONSE TO "DESERT A-TYPE-BUGS-REPORT 9/25/90" 

Thanks for faxing this. It has been a help to us in deciding what 
is going on with the latest version of Desert. 

In particular, we had previously thought that the lock-ups were 
all due to a mysterious hardware-related problem, but it now seems 
likely that most are not. 

* Bugs 1, 3 and probably 4 are all the same problem. It seems likely 
  that the game workspace is being corrupted by the new version of 
  the hospital game. The game manages to continue, but when it 
  de-allocates its workspace before loading the shell overlay, the 
  corruption is discovered. ("4" occurs at exactly the same time as 
  the others - presumably the corruption had progressed further this 
  time and the program crashed before outputting its error message). 

  As I said to Chris, it is best to quit if the game reports an error. 
  The workspace has been corrupted in some way, so it is not surprising 
  if you go on to get other errors - e.g the nurse in the wrong place. 
  Nick will make "DE-ALLOCATE" errors fatal in future. 

* Bug 2 is as reported. Nick will try to fix it. 

* Bugs 5 and 8 are already fixed (we spotted them in testing today). 
  Bug 5 is actually a debug feature - press keypad 1 and 3 to toggle. 

* Bug 6 is puzzling. 

* Bug 7 looks like the only one of the type we were expecting - i.e 
  the game drops dead with no excuse. If there is a "mysterious 
  hardware-related problem", this is the only real evidence for it. 

                            Regards, 


                                    Pete Austin 

       PS: NICK SAYS THERE IS ACTUALLY NO SUCH THING AS A 
       "DE-ALLOCATE ERROR", THOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIANTS 
       SUCH AS "DE-ALLOCATE ADDRESS ERROR". IT MIGHT HELP IF 
       YOU COULD TELL US WHICH TYPE(S) YOU'RE GETTING. THANKS
