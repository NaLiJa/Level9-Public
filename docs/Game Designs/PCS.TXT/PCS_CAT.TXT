Level 9 are stopping doing text adventures! Future games 
will use our new 16-bit games system, with arcade-type 
play, 3D animation, digitised sound, and of course the 
data compression that's always been our trademark.  

The first products are as good as finished, though 
confidential. But there are demos on the stand to give 
you a hint of what's to come. 

Scapeghost. Level 9's final traditional adventure is on 
sale here, at #19.95 for 16-bit or 3" disc, and #14.95 
for 8-bit versions. 

It's not easy being a ghost; betrayed to a criminal gang 
and then falsely blamed for their escape and your death. 
But reincarnated in your old haunts, with your detective 
skills and new psychic powers, a spirited revenge is a 
dead cert. The gangsters haven't the ghost of a chance!
