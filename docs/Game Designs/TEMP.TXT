5) CLIMB WALL. A large figure of Robin is shown climbing the 
   castle wall, which scrolls and is two screens high. Move the 
   cursor onto his next hand/foothold, click on it and Robin 
   will move his nearest hand/foot onto the hold, provided he 
   can reach. The game ends at the top of the wall. 

   If neither foot is supported, Robin slips to full-length; if 
   neither hand is supported he falls.
